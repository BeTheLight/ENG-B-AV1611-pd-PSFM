\c 1
\p
\v 1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsell of the vngodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornefull.
\p
\v 2 But his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doeth he meditate day and night.
\p
\v 3 And he shalbe like a tree planted by the riuers of water, that bringeth foorth his fruit in his season, his leafe also shall not wither, and whatsoeuer he doeth, shall prosper.
\p
\v 4 The vngodly are not so: but are like the chaffe, which the winde driueth away.
\p
\v 5 Therefore the vngodly shall not stand in the iudgement, nor sinners in the Congregation of the righteous.
\p
\v 6 For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the vngodly shall perish.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vaine thing?
\p
\v 2 The Kings of the earth set themselues, and the rulers take counsell together, against the Lord, and against his Anoynted, saying,
\p
\v 3 Let vs breake their bandes asunder, and cast away their cords from vs.
\p
\v 4 Hee that sitteth in the heauens shal laugh: the Lord shall haue them in derision.
\p
\v 5 Then shall hee speake vnto them in his wrath, and vexe them in his sore displeasure.
\p
\v 6 Yet haue I set my King vpon my holy hill of Sion.
\p
\v 7 I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said vnto mee, Thou art my sonne, this day haue I begotten thee.
\p
\v 8 Aske of me, and I shall giue thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the vttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
\p
\v 9 Thou shalt breake them with a rod of iron, thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potters vessell.
\p
\v 10 Bee wise now therefore, O yee Kings: be instructed ye Iudges of the earth.
\p
\v 11 Serue the Lord with feare, and reioyce with trembling.
\p
\v 12 Kisse the Sonne lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid when he fled from Absalom his sonne. Lord, how are they increased that trouble mee? many are they that rise vp against me.
\p
\v 2 Many there bee which say of my soule, There is no helpe for him in God. Selah.
\p
\v 3 But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter vp of mine head.
\p
\v 4 I cryed vnto the Lord with my voyce, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.
\p
\v 5 I layd me downe and slept; I awaked, for the Lord sustained me.
\p
\v 6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that haue set themselues against me round about.
\p
\v 7 Arise, O Lord, saue mee, O my God; for thou hast smitten all mine enemies vpon the cheeke bone: thou hast broken the teeth of the vngodly.
\p
\v 8 Saluation belongeth vnto the Lord: thy blessing is vpon thy people. Selah.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician on Neginoth, A Psalme of Dauid. Heare me, when I call, O God of my righteousnesse: thou hast inlarged mee when I was in distresse, haue mercy vpon me, and heare my prayer.
\p
\v 2 O ye sonnes of men, how long will yee turne my glory into shame? how long will yee loue vanitie, and seeke after leasing? Selah.
\p
\v 3 But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly, for himselfe: the Lord will heare when I call vnto him.
\p
\v 4 Stand in awe, and sinne not: commune with your owne heart vpon your bed, and be still. Selah.
\p
\v 5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousnesse, and put your trust in the Lord.
\p
\v 6 There be many that say, Who wil shew vs any good? Lord lift thou vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs.
\p
\v 7 Thou hast put gladnesse in my heart, more then in the time that their corne and their wine increased.
\p
\v 8 I will both lay mee downe in peace, and sleepe: for thou Lord only makest me dwell in safetie.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician vpon Nehiloth, A Psalme of Dauid. Giue eare to my words, O Lord, consider my meditation.
\p
\v 2 Hearken vnto the voice of my crie, my King, and my God: for vnto thee will I pray.
\p
\v 3 My voyce shalt thou heare in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer vnto thee, and will looke vp.
\p
\v 4 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickednesse: neither shall euill dwell with thee.
\p
\v 5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest al workers of iniquity
\p
\v 6 Thou shalt destroy them that speake leasing: the Lord will abhorre the bloodie and deceitfull man.
\p
\v 7 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy feare will I worship toward thy holy temple.
\p
\v 8 Lead me O Lord, in thy righteousnesse, because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
\p
\v 9 For there is no faithfulnes in their mouth, their inward part is very wickednesse: their throat is an open sepulchre, they flatter with their tongue.
\p
\v 10 Destroy thou them, O God, let them fall by their owne counsels: cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions, for they haue rebelled against thee.
\p
\v 11 But let all those that put their trust in thee, reioyce: let them euer shout for ioy; because thou defendest them: let them also that loue thy name, be ioyfull in thee.
\p
\v 12 For thou, Lord, wilt blesse the righteous: with fauour wilt thou compasse him as with a shield.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician on Neginoth vpon Sheminith, A Psalme of Dauid. O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
\p
\v 2 Haue mercy vpon me, O Lord, for I am weake: O Lord heale mee, for my bones are vexed.
\p
\v 3 My soule is also sore vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long?
\p
\v 4 Returne, O Lord, deliuer my soule: oh saue mee, for thy mercies sake.
\p
\v 5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the graue who shall giue thee thankes?
\p
\v 6 I am weary with my groning, all the night make I my bed to swim: I water my couch with my teares.
\p
\v 7 Mine eie is consumed because of griefe; it waxeth olde because of all mine enemies.
\p
\v 8 Depart from me, all yee workers of iniquitie: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping.
\p
\v 9 The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receiue my prayer.
\p
\v 10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them returne and be ashamed suddainly.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 Shiggaion of Dauid; which he sang vnto the Lord concerning the words of Cush the Beniamite. O Lord, my God, in thee doe I put my trust: saue me from all them that persecute me, and deliuer me.
\p
\v 2 Least hee teare my soule like a lyon, renting it in pieces, while there is none to deliuer.
\p
\v 3 O Lord my God, if I haue done this; if there be iniquitie in my hands:
\p
\v 4 If I haue rewarded euill vnto him that was at peace with me: (yea I haue deliuered him that without cause is mine enemie.)
\p
\v 5 Let the enemie persecute my soule, and take it, yea let him tread downe my life vpon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.
\p
\v 6 Arise, O Lord, in thine anger, lift vp thy selfe, because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the iudgement that thou hast commanded.
\p
\v 7 So shall the congregation of the people compasse thee about: for their sakes therefore returne thou on high.
\p
\v 8 The Lord shal iudge the people: iudge me, O Lord, according to my righteousnesse, and according to mine integritie that is in me.
\p
\v 9 Oh let the wickednes of the wicked come to an end, but establish the iust: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reines.
\p
\v 10 My defence is of God, which saueth the vpright in heart.
\p
\v 11 God iudgeth the righteous, and God is angrie with the wicked euery-day.
\p
\v 12 If he turne not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bowe, and made it ready.
\p
\v 13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrowes against the persecutors.
\p
\v 14 Behold, he trauelleth with iniquitie, and hath conceiued mischiefe, and brought forth falshood.
\p
\v 15 He made a pit and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.
\p
\v 16 His mischiefe shall returne vpon his owne head, and his violent dealing shall come downe vpon his owne pate.
\p
\v 17 I will praise the Lord according to his righteousnesse: and will sing praise to the name of the Lord most high.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musicion vpon Gittith, a Psalme of Dauid. O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory aboue the heauens.
\p
\v 2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemie and the auenger.
\p
\v 3 When I consider thy heauens, the worke of thy fingers, the moone and the starres which thou hast ordained;
\p
\v 4 What is man, that thou art mindfull of him? and the sonne of man, that thou visitest him?
\p
\v 5 For thou hast made him a little lower then the Angels; and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
\p
\v 6 Thou madest him to haue dominion ouer the workes of thy hands; thou hast put all things vnder his feete.
\p
\v 7 All sheepe and oxen, yea and the beasts of the field.
\p
\v 8 The foule of the aire, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoeuer passeth through the paths of the seas.
\p
\v 9 O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!

\c 9
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician vpon MuthLabben. A Psalme of Dauid. I wil praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart: I will shewe foorth all thy maruellous workes.
\p
\v 2 I will bee glad and reioyce in thee: I will sing prayse to thy name, O thou most High.
\p
\v 3 When mine enemies are turned backe, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
\p
\v 4 For thou hast maintained my right, and my cause: thou satest in the throne iudging right.
\p
\v 5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked; thou hast put out their name for euer and euer.
\p
\v 6 O thou enemie, destructions are come to a perpetuall end; and thou hast destroyed cities, their memoriall is perished with them.
\p
\v 7 But the Lord shall endure for euer: he hath prepared his throne for iudgement.
\p
\v 8 And hee shall iudge the world in righteousnesse; he shall minister iudgement to the people in vprightnesse.
\p
\v 9 The Lord also will bee a refuge for the oppressed: a refuge, in times of trouble.
\p
\v 10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou Lord hast not forsaken them that seeke thee.
\p
\v 11 Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Sion: declare among the people his doings.
\p
\v 12 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembreth them: he forgetteth not the crie of the humble.
\p
\v 13 Haue mercie vpon me O Lord, consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest mee vp from the gates of death:
\p
\v 14 That I may shew foorth all thy prayse in the gates of the daughter of Sion: I will reioyce in thy saluation.
\p
\v 15 The heathen are sunke downe in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid, is their own foot taken.
\p
\v 16 The Lord is knowen by the iudgement which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the worke of his owne hands. Higgaion. Selah.
\p
\v 17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.
\p
\v 18 For the needie shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poore shall not perish for euer.
\p
\v 19 Arise, O Lord, let not man preuaile: let the heathen bee iudged in thy sight.
\p
\v 20 Put them in feare, O Lord: that the nations may know themselues to be but men. Selah.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Why standest thou afarre off, O Lord? why hidest thou thy selfe in times of trouble?
\p
\v 2 The wicked in his pride doeth persecute the poore: let them be taken in the deuices that they haue imagined.
\p
\v 3 For the wicked boasteth of his hearts desire, and blesseth the couetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.
\p
\v 4 The wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seeke after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
\p
\v 5 His wayes are alwayes grieuous, thy iudgements are farre aboue out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
\p
\v 6 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moued: for I shall neuer be in aduersitie.
\p
\v 7 His mouth is full of cursing, and deceit, and fraud: vnder his tongue is mischiefe and vanitie.
\p
\v 8 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doeth he murder the innocent: his eyes are priuily set against the poore.
\p
\v 9 He lieth in waite secretly as a lyon in his denne, he lieth in wait to catch the poore: he doth catch the poore when he draweth him into his net.
\p
\v 10 He croucheth, and humbleth himselfe, that the poore may fall by his strong ones.
\p
\v 11 Hee hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face, hee will neuer see it.
\p
\v 12 Arise, O Lord, O God lift vp thine hand: forget not the humble.
\p
\v 13 Wherefore doeth the wicked contemne God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.
\p
\v 14 Thou hast seene it, for thou beholdest mischiefe and spite to requite it with thy hand: the poore committeth himselfe vnto thee, thou art the helper of the fatherlesse.
\p
\v 15 Breake thou the arme of the wicked, and the euill man: seeke out his wickednes, till thou finde none.
\p
\v 16 The Lord is King for euer and euer: the heathen are perished out of his land.
\p
\v 17 Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine eare to heare,
\p
\v 18 To iudge the fatherlesse and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppresse.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician. A Psalme of Dauid. In the Lord put I my trust: how say yee to my soule, Flee as a bird to your mountaine?
\p
\v 2 For loe, the wicked bende their bow, they make ready their arrow vpon the string: that they may priuily shoote at the vpright in heart.
\p
\v 3 If the foundations bee destroyed: what can the righteous doe?
\p
\v 4 The Lord is in his holy Temple, the Lords Throne is in heauen: his eyes beholde, his eye lids trie the children of men.
\p
\v 5 The Lord trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loueth violence, his soule hateth.
\p
\v 6 Upon the wicked hee shall raine snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.
\p
\v 7 For the righteous Lord loueth righteousnesse: his countenance doeth behold the vpright.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician vpon Sheminith. A Psalme of Dauid. Helpe Lord, for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithfull faile from among the children of men.
\p
\v 2 They speake vanitie euery one with his neighbour: with flattering lips, and with a double heart do they speake.
\p
\v 3 The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things.
\p
\v 4 Who haue said, with our tongue wil we preuaile, our lips are our owne: who is Lord ouer vs?
\p
\v 5 For the oppression of the poore, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise (saith the Lord,) I will set him in safetie from him that puffeth at him.
\p
\v 6 The wordes of the Lord are pure wordes: as siluer tried in a fornace of earth purified seuen times.
\p
\v 7 Thou shalt keepe them, (O Lord,) thou shalt preserue them, from this generation for euer.
\p
\v 8 The wicked walke on euery side, when the vilest men are exalted.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician. A Psalme of Dauid. How long wilt thou forget mee (O Lord) for euer? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
\p
\v 2 How long shall I take counsel in my soule, hauing sorrow in my heart dayly? how long shall mine enemie be exalted ouer me?
\p
\v 3 Consider and heare me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleepe of death.
\p
\v 4 Least mine enimie say, I haue preuailed against him: and those that trouble mee, reioyce, when I am moued.
\p
\v 5 But I haue trusted in thy mercy, my heart shall reioyce in thy saluation.
\p
\v 6 I will sing vnto the Lord, because hee hath dealt bountifully with mee.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician, A Psalme of Dauid. The foole hath sayd in his heart, There is no God: they are corrupt, they haue done abominable workes, there is none that doeth good.
\p
\v 2 The Lord looked downe from heauen vpon the children of men; to see if there were any that did vnderstand and seeke God.
\p
\v 3 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no not one.
\p
\v 4 Haue all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eate vp my people as they eate bread, and call not vpon the Lord.
\p
\v 5 There were they in great feare; for God is in the generation of the righteous.
\p
\v 6 You haue shamed the counsell of the poore; because the Lord is his refuge.
\p
\v 7 O that the saluation of Israel were come out of Sion! when the Lord bringeth backe the captiuitie of his people, Iacob shall reioyce, and Israel shalbe glad.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
\p
\v 2 Hee that walketh vprightly, and worketh righteousnesse, and speaketh the trueth in his heart.
\p
\v 3 Hee that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doth euill to his neighbour, nor taketh vp a reproach against his neighbour.
\p
\v 4 In whose eies a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that feare the Lord: he that sweareth to his owne hurt, and changeth not.
\p
\v 5 He that putteth not out his money to vsury, nor taketh reward against the innocent: he that doth these things, shall neuer be moued.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 Michtam of Dauid. Preserue me, O God: for in thee doe I put my trust.
\p
\v 2 O my soule, thou hast sayd vnto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my goodnes extendeth not to thee:
\p
\v 3 But to the Saints, that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.
\p
\v 4 Their sorrowes shalbe multiplied, that hasten after another God: their drinke offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take vp their names into my lippes.
\p
\v 5 The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.
\p
\v 6 The lines are fallen vnto mee in pleasant places; yea, I haue a goodly heritage.
\p
\v 7 I will blesse the Lord, who hath giuen me counsell: my reines also instruct me in the night seasons.
\p
\v 8 I haue set the Lord alwaies before me: because hee is at my right hand, I shall not be moued.
\p
\v 9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory reioyceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
\p
\v 10 For thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption.
\p
\v 11 Thou wilt shewe me the path of life: in thy presence is fulnesse of ioy, at thy right hand there are pleasures for euermore.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 A prayer of Dauid. Heare the right, O Lord, attend vnto my crie, giue eare vnto my prayer, that goeth not out of fained lips.
\p
\v 2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence: let thine eyes beholde the things that are equall.
\p
\v 3 Thou hast prooued mine heart, thou hast visited me in the night, thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing: I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgresse.
\p
\v 4 Concerning the workes of men, by the word of thy lips, I haue kept me from the paths of the destroyer.
\p
\v 5 Hold vp my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
\p
\v 6 I haue called vpon thee, for thou wilt heare me, O God: incline thine eare vnto me, and heare my speach.
\p
\v 7 Shewe thy marueilous louing kindnesse, O thou that sauest by thy right hand, them which put their trust in thee, fr&#333; those that rise vp against them.
\p
\v 8 Keepe me as the apple of the eye: hide mee vnder the shadowe of thy wings,
\p
\v 9 From the wicked that oppresse me, from my deadly enemies, who compasse me about.
\p
\v 10 They are inclosed in their owne fat: with their mouth they speake proudly.
\p
\v 11 They haue now compassed vs in our steps: they haue set their eyes bowing downe to the earth:
\p
\v 12 Like as a lyon that is greedie of his pray, and as it were a yong lyon lurking in secret places.
\p
\v 13 Arise, O Lord, disappoint him, cast him downe: deliuer my soule from the wicked, which is thy sword:
\p
\v 14 From men which are thy hand, O Lord, from men of the world, which haue their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: They are full of children, and leaue the rest of their substance to their babes.
\p
\v 15 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousnesse: I shall bee satisfied, when I awake, with thy likenesse.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musicion, a psalme of Dauid, the seruant of the Lord, who spake vnto the Lord the words of this song, in the day that the Lord deliuered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said, I will loue thee, O Lord, my strength.
\p
\v 2 The Lord is my rocke, and my fortresse, and my deliuerer: my God, my strength in whome I will trust, my buckler, and the horne of my saluation, and my high tower.
\p
\v 3 I will call vpon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saued from mine enemies.
\p
\v 4 The sorrowes of death compassed me, and the floods of vngodly men made me afraid.
\p
\v 5 The sorrowes of hell compassed me about: the snares of death preuented me.
\p
\v 6 In my distresse I called vpon the Lord, and cryed vnto my God: hee heard my voyce out of his temple, and my crie came before him, euen into his eares.
\p
\v 7 Then the earth shooke and trembled; the foundations also of the hilles mooued and were shaken, because hee was wroth.
\p
\v 8 There went vp a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth deuoured, coales were kindled by it.
\p
\v 9 He bowed the heauens also, and came downe: and darkenesse was vnder his feet.
\p
\v 10 And he rode vpon a Cherub, and did flie: yea he did flie vpon the wings of the wind.
\p
\v 11 He made darkenes his secret place: his pauilion round about him, were darke waters, and thicke cloudes of the skies.
\p
\v 12 At the brightnes that was before him his thicke clouds passed, haile stones and coales of fire.
\p
\v 13 The Lord also thundered in the heauens, and the highest gaue his voyce; hailestones and coales of fire.
\p
\v 14 Yea, he sent out his arrowes, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
\p
\v 15 Then the chanels of waters were seene, and the foundations of the world were discouered: at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
\p
\v 16 He sent from aboue, he tooke me, he drew me out of many waters.
\p
\v 17 He deliuered me from my strong enemie, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.
\p
\v 18 They preuented me in the day of my calamitie: but the Lord was my stay.
\p
\v 19 He brought me forth also into a large place: he deliuered me, because he delighted in me.
\p
\v 20 The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousnesse, according to the cleannesse of my hands hath hee recompensed me.
\p
\v 21 For I haue kept the wayes of the Lord, and haue not wickedly departed from my God.
\p
\v 22 For all his iudgements were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
\p
\v 23 I was also vpright before him: and I kept my selfe from mine iniquity.
\p
\v 24 Therefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousnesse, according to the cleannesse of my hands in his eye-sight.
\p
\v 25 With the mercifull thou wilt shew thy selfe mercifull, with an vpright man thou wilt shew thy selfe vpright.
\p
\v 26 With the pure thou wilt shewe thy selfe pure, and with the froward thou wilt shew thy selfe froward.
\p
\v 27 For thou wilt saue the afflicted people: but wilt bring downe high lookes.
\p
\v 28 For thou wilt light my candle: the Lord my God will enlighten my darkenesse.
\p
\v 29 For by thee I haue run through a troupe? and by my God haue I leaped ouer a wall.
\p
\v 30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.
\p
\v 31 For who is God saue the Lord? or who is a rocke saue our God?
\p
\v 32 It is God that girdeth mee with strength, and maketh my way perfect.
\p
\v 33 Hee maketh my feete like hindes feete, and setteth me vpon my high places.
\p
\v 34 He teacheth my hands to warre, so that a bow of steele is broken by mine armes.
\p
\v 35 Thou hast also giuen me the shield of thy saluation: and thy right hand hath holden me vp, and thy gentlenesse hath made me great.
\p
\v 36 Thou hast enlarged my steppes vnder me; that my feete did not slippe.
\p
\v 37 I haue pursued mine enemies, and ouertaken them: neither did I turne againe till they were consumed.
\p
\v 38 I haue wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen vnder my feete.
\p
\v 39 For thou hast girded mee with strength vnto the battell: thou hast subdued vnder me, those that rose vp against me.
\p
\v 40 Thou hast also giuen mee the neckes of mine enemies: that I might destroy them that hate me.
\p
\v 41 They cried, but there was none to saue them: euen vnto the Lord, but he answered them not.
\p
\v 42 Then did I beate them small as the dust before the winde: I did cast them out, as the dirt in the streetes.
\p
\v 43 Thou hast deliuered me from the striuings of the people, and thou hast made mee the head of the heathen: a people whom I haue not knowen, shall serue me.
\p
\v 44 As soone as they heare of mee, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselues vnto me.
\p
\v 45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.
\p
\v 46 The Lord liueth, and blessed be my rocke: and let the God of my saluation be exalted.
\p
\v 47 It is God that auengeth mee, and subdueth the people vnder me.
\p
\v 48 He deliuereth me from mine enemies: yea thou liftest mee vp aboue those that rise vp against me; thou hast deliuered me from the violent man.
\p
\v 49 Therfore will I giue thankes vnto thee, (O Lord) among the heathen: and sing prayses vnto thy name.
\p
\v 50 Great deliuerance giueth he to his King: and sheweth mercy to his Annointed, to Dauid, and to his seede for euermore.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician, A Psalme of Dauid. The heauens declare the glory of God: and the firmament sheweth his handy worke.
\p
\v 2 Day vnto day vttereth speach, and night vnto night sheweth knowledge.
\p
\v 3 There is no speach nor language, where their voyce is not heard.
\p
\v 4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world: In them hath he set a tabernacle for the Sunne.
\p
\v 5 Which is as a bridegrome comming out of his chamber, and reioyceth as a strong man to runne a race.
\p
\v 6 His going forth is from the end of the heauen, and his circuite vnto the ends of it: and there is nothing hidde from the heat thereof.
\p
\v 7 The Law of the Lord is perfect, conuerting the soule: the testimonie of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
\p
\v 8 The Statutes of the Lord are right, reioycing the heart: the Commandement of the Lord is pure, inlightning the eyes.
\p
\v 9 The feare of the Lord is cleane, enduring for euer: the Iudgements of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.
\p
\v 10 More to bee desired are they then gold, yea, then much fine gold: sweeter also then hony, and the hony combe.
\p
\v 11 Moreouer by them is thy seruant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.
\p
\v 12 Who can vnderstand his errours? cleanse thou me from secret faults.
\p
\v 13 Keepe back thy seruant also from presumptuous sinnes, let them not haue dominion ouer me: then shall I be vpright, and I shalbe innocent from the great transgression.
\p
\v 14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, bee acceptable in thy sight, O Lord my strength, and my redeemer.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician. A Psalme of Dauid. The Lord heare thee in the day of trouble, the Name of the God of Iacob defend thee.
\p
\v 2 Send thee helpe from the Sanctuary: and strengthen thee out of Sion.
\p
\v 3 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice. Selah.
\p
\v 4 Graunt thee according to thine owne heart, and fulfill all thy counsell.
\p
\v 5 We will reioyce in thy saluation, and in the Name of our God we will set vp our banners: the Lord fulfill all thy petitions.
\p
\v 6 Now know I, that the Lord saueth his Anointed: he wil heare him from his holy heauen, with the sauing strength of his right hand.
\p
\v 7 Some trust in charets, and some in horses: but wee will remember the Name of the Lord our God.
\p
\v 8 They are brought downe and fallen: but we are risen, and stand vpright.
\p
\v 9 Saue Lord, let the King heare vs when we call.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician. A Psalme of Dauid. The King shall ioy in thy strength, O Lord: and in thy saluation how greatly shall he reioyce?
\p
\v 2 Thou hast giuen him his hearts desire; and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.
\p
\v 3 For thou preuentest him with the blessings of goodnesse: thou settest a Crowne of pure gold on his head.
\p
\v 4 He asked life of thee, and thou gauest it him, euen length of dayes for euer and euer.
\p
\v 5 His glory is great in thy saluation: honour and Maiestie hast thou layde vpon him.
\p
\v 6 For thou hast made him most blessed for euer: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
\p
\v 7 For the King trusteth in the Lord, and through the mercy of the most High, he shall not be moued.
\p
\v 8 Thine hand shall finde out all thine enemies, thy right hand shal finde out those that hate thee.
\p
\v 9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery ouen in the time of thine anger: the Lord shall swallow them vp in his wrath, and the fire shall deuoure them.
\p
\v 10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
\p
\v 11 For they intended euill against thee: they imagined a mischieuous deuice, which they are not able to performe.
\p
\v 12 Therefore shalt thou make them turne their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrowes vpon thy strings, against the face of them.
\p
\v 13 Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine owne strength: so will wee sing, aud praise thy power.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician vpon Aijeleth Shahar. A Psalme of Dauid. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken mee? Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?
\p
\v 2 O my God, I crie in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.
\p
\v 3 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel!
\p
\v 4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliuer them.
\p
\v 5 They cryed vnto thee, and were deliuered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
\p
\v 6 But I am a worme, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.
\p
\v 7 All they that see me, laugh me to scorne: they shoote out the lippe, they shake the head, saying,
\p
\v 8 He trusted on the Lord, that he would deliuer him: let him deliuer him, seeing he delighted in him.
\p
\v 9 But thou art hee that tooke mee out of the wombe; thou didst make me hope, when I was vpon my mothers breasts.
\p
\v 10 I was cast vpon thee from the wombe: thou art my God from my mothers belly.
\p
\v 11 Be not farre from me, for trouble is neere; for there is none to helpe.
\p
\v 12 Many bulles haue compassed me: strong bulles of Bashan haue beset me round.
\p
\v 13 They gaped vpon me with their mouthes, as a rauening and a roaring Lyon.
\p
\v 14 I am powred out like water, and all my bones are out of ioynt: my heart is like waxe, it is melted in the middest of my bowels.
\p
\v 15 My strength is dried vp like a potsheard: and my tongue cleaueth to my iawes; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
\p
\v 16 For dogges haue compassed me: the assembly of the wicked haue inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feete.
\p
\v 17 I may tell all my bones: they looke and stare vpon me.
\p
\v 18 They part my garments among them, and cast lots vpon my vesture.
\p
\v 19 But be not thou farre from mee, O Lord; O my strength, hast thee to helpe me.
\p
\v 20 Deliuer my soule from the sword: my darling from the power of the dogge.
\p
\v 21 Saue me from the lyons mouth: for thou hast heard me from the hornes of the vnicornes.
\p
\v 22 I will declare thy name vnto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
\p
\v 23 Yee that feare the Lord, praise him; all yee the seede of Iacob glorifie him, and feare him all yee the seede of Israel.
\p
\v 24 For he hath not despised, nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him, but when he cried vnto him, he heard.
\p
\v 25 My praise shalbe of thee, in the great congregation: I will pay my vowes, before them that feare him.
\p
\v 26 The meeke shall eate and be satisfied: they shall praise the Lord that seeke him; your heart shall liue for euer.
\p
\v 27 All the ends of the world shall remember, and turne vnto the Lord: and all the kinreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
\p
\v 28 For the kingdome is the Lords: and he is the gouernour among the nations.
\p
\v 29 All they that be fat vpon earth shall eate and worship: all they that goe downe to the dust shall bow before him, and none can keepe aliue his owne soule.
\p
\v 30 A seed shall serue him; it shalbe accounted to the Lord for a generation.
\p
\v 31 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousnes vnto a people that shalbe borne, that he hath done this.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. The Lord is my shepheard, I shall not want.
\p
\v 2 He maketh me to lie downe in greene pastures: he leadeth mee beside the still waters.
\p
\v 3 He restoreth my soule: he leadeth me in the pathes of righteousnes, for his names sake.
\p
\v 4 Yea though I walke through the valley of the shadowe of death, I will feare no euill: for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staffe, they comfort me.
\p
\v 5 Thou preparest a table before me, in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oyle, my cuppe runneth ouer.
\p
\v 6 Surely goodnes and mercie shall followe me all the daies of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for euer.

\c 24
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. The earth is the Lords, and the fulnesse thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
\p
\v 2 For he hath founded it vpon the seas, and established it vpon the floods.
\p
\v 3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? and who shall stand in his holy place?
\p
\v 4 He that hath cleane hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lift vp his soule vnto vanitie, nor sworne deceitfully.
\p
\v 5 Hee shall receiue the blessing from the Lord, and righteousnesse from the God of his saluation.
\p
\v 6 This is the generation of them that seeke him: that seeke thy face, O Iacob. Selah.
\p
\v 7 Lift vp your heads, O yee gates, and be ye lift vp ye euerlasting doores; and the King of glory shall come in.
\p
\v 8 Who is this king of glory? the Lord strong & mightie, the Lord mighty in battell.
\p
\v 9 Lift vp your heads, O ye gates, euen lift them vp, ye euerlasting doores; and the king of glory shall come in.
\p
\v 10 Who is this king of glory? the Lord of hostes, he is the king of glory. Selah.

\c 25
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. Vnto thee, O Lord, doe I lift vp my soule.
\p
\v 2 O my God, I trust in thee, let me not be ashamed: let not mine enemies triumph ouer me.
\p
\v 3 Yea let none that waite on thee, be ashamed: let them bee ashamed which transgresse without cause.
\p
\v 4 Shewe mee thy wayes, O Lord: teach me thy pathes.
\p
\v 5 Lead me in thy trueth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my saluation, on thee doe I waite all the day.
\p
\v 6 Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies, and thy louing kindnesses: for they haue beene euer of old.
\p
\v 7 Remember not the sinnes of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercie remember thou me, for thy goodnesse sake, O Lord.
\p
\v 8 Good and vpright is the Lord: therefore will hee teach sinners in the way.
\p
\v 9 The meeke will he guide in iudgement: and the meeke will he teach his way.
\p
\v 10 All the pathes of the Lord are mercy and truth: vnto such as keepe his couenant, and his testimonies.
\p
\v 11 For thy names sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquitie: for it is great.
\p
\v 12 What man is he that feareth the Lord? him shall he teach in the way that he shall chuse.
\p
\v 13 His soule shall dwell at ease: and his seede shall inherite the earth.
\p
\v 14 The secret of the Lord is with them that feare him: and he will shew them his couenant.
\p
\v 15 Mine eyes are euer towards the Lord: for hee shall plucke my feete out of the net.
\p
\v 16 Turne thee vnto me, and haue mercy vpon me: for I am desolate and afflicted.
\p
\v 17 The troubles of my heart are inlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.
\p
\v 18 Looke vpon mine affliction, aud my paine, and forgiue all my sinnes.
\p
\v 19 Consider mine enemies: for they are many, and they hate me with cruell hatred.
\p
\v 20 O keepe my soule and deliuer me: let me not bee ashamed, for I put my trust in thee.
\p
\v 21 Let integritie and vprightnesse preserue me: for I wait on thee.
\p
\v 22 Redeeme Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.

\c 26
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. Iudge me, O Lord, for I haue walked in mine integritie: I haue trusted also in the Lord: therfore I shall not slide.
\p
\v 2 Examine me, O Lord, and proue me; try my reines and my heart.
\p
\v 3 For thy louing kindnesse is before mine eyes: and I haue walked in thy trueth.
\p
\v 4 I haue not sate with vaine persons, neither will I goe in with dissemblers.
\p
\v 5 I haue hated the congregation of euill doers: and will not sit with the wicked.
\p
\v 6 I will wash mine hands in innocencie: so will I compasse thine Altar, O Lord:
\p
\v 7 That I may publish with the voyce of thankesgiuing, and tell of all thy wonderous workes.
\p
\v 8 Lord, I haue loued the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.
\p
\v 9 Gather not my soule with sinners, nor my life with bloody men.
\p
\v 10 In whose hands is mischiefe: and their right hand is full of bribes.
\p
\v 11 But as for mee, I will walke in mine integritie: redeeme me, and bee mercifull vnto me.
\p
\v 12 My foot standeth in an euen place: in the congregations will I blesse the Lord.

\c 27
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. The Lord is my light, and my saluation, whome shal I feare? the Lord is the strength of my life, of wh&#333; shall I be afraid?
\p
\v 2 When the wicked, euen mine enemies and my foes came vpon me to eat vp my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
\p
\v 3 Though an host should encampe against me, my heart shall not feare: though warre should rise against me, in this will I be confident.
\p
\v 4 One thing haue I desired of the Lord, that will I seeke after: that I may dwel in the house of the Lord, all the dayes of my life, to behold the beautie of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple.
\p
\v 5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pauilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me, hee shall set me vp vpon a rocke.
\p
\v 6 And now shall mine head be lifted vp aboue mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of ioy, I will sing, yea, I will sing praises vnto the Lord.
\p
\v 7 Heare, O Lord, when I crie with my voice: haue mercie also vpon mee, and answere me.
\p
\v 8 When thou saidst, Seeke ye my face, my heart said vnto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seeke.
\p
\v 9 Hide not thy face farre fr&#333; me, put not thy seruant away in anger: thou hast bin my helpe, leaue me not, neither forsake me, O God of my saluation.
\p
\v 10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me vp.
\p
\v 11 Teach me thy way, O Lord, and leade me in a plaine path, because of mine enemies.
\p
\v 12 Deliuer me not ouer vnto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen vp against me, and such as breath out crueltie.
\p
\v 13 I had fainted, vnlesse I had beleeued to see the goodnesse of the Lord in the land of the liuing.
\p
\v 14 Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.

\c 28
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. Vnto thee will I cry, O Lord, my rocke, be not silent to mee: lest if thou be silent to me, I become like them that goe downe into the pit.
\p
\v 2 Heare the voyce of my supplications, when I cry vnto thee: when I lift vp my handes toward thy holy Oracle.
\p
\v 3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquitie: which speake peace to their neighbors, but mischiefe is in their hearts.
\p
\v 4 Giue them according to their deedes, and according to the wickednes of their endeuours: giue them after the worke of their handes, render to them their desert.
\p
\v 5 Because they regard not the workes of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands, he shal destroy them, and not build them vp.
\p
\v 6 Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voyce of my supplications.
\p
\v 7 The Lord is my strength, and my shield, my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly reioyceth, and with my song will I praise him.
\p
\v 8 The Lord is their strength, and hee is the sauing strength of his Anointed.
\p
\v 9 Saue thy people, and blesse thine inheritance, feede them also, and lift them vp for euer.

\c 29
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. Giue vnto the Lord (O ye mighty) giue vnto the Lord glory and strength.
\p
\v 2 Giue vnto the Lord the glory due vnto his Name; worship the Lord in the beautie of holinesse.
\p
\v 3 The voice of the Lord is vpon the waters: the God of glory thundreth, the Lord is vpon many waters.
\p
\v 4 The voice of the Lord is powerfull; the voyce of the Lord is full of Maiestie.
\p
\v 5 The voyce of the Lord breaketh the Cedars: yea, the Lord breaketh the Cedars of Lebanon.
\p
\v 6 He maketh them also to skip like a calfe: Lebanon, and Sirion like a yong Unicorne.
\p
\v 7 The voyce of the Lord diuideth the flames of fire.
\p
\v 8 The voyce of the Lord shaketh the wildernes: the Lord shaketh the wildernesse of Kadesh.
\p
\v 9 The voice of the Lord maketh the hindes to calue, and discouereth the forrests: and in his Temple doeth euery one speake of his glory.
\p
\v 10 The Lord sitteth vpon the flood: yea the Lord sitteth King for euer.
\p
\v 11 The Lord will giue strength vnto his people; the Lord will blesse his people with peace.

\c 30
\p
\v 1 A Psalme, and song at the dedication of the house of Dauid. I wil extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast lifted me vp; and hast not made my foes to reioyce ouer me.
\p
\v 2 O Lord my God, I cried vnto thee, and thou hast healed me.
\p
\v 3 O Lord, thou hast brought vp my soule from the graue: thou hast kept me aliue, that I should not goe downe to the pit.
\p
\v 4 Sing vnto the Lord, (O yee Saints of his) and giue thanks at the remembrance of his holinesse.
\p
\v 5 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his fauour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but ioy commeth in the morning.
\p
\v 6 And in my prosperitie I said, I shall neuer be mooued.
\p
\v 7 Lord, by thy fauour thou hast made my mountaine to stand strong: Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.
\p
\v 8 I cried to thee, O Lord: and vnto the Lord I made supplication.
\p
\v 9 What profit is there in my blood, when I goe downe to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy trueth?
\p
\v 10 Heare, O Lord, and haue mercie vpon me: Lord be thou my helper.
\p
\v 11 Thou hast turned for mee my mourning into dauncing: thou hast put off my sackecloth, and girded mee with gladnesse:
\p
\v 12 To the end that my glory may sing prayse to thee, and not be silent: O Lord my God, I will giue thankes vnto thee for euer.

\c 31
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician, A Psalme of Dauid. In thee, O Lord, doe I put my trust, let me neuer be ashamed: deliuer me in thy righteousnesse.
\p
\v 2 Bowe downe thine eare to me, deliuer me speedily: be thou my strong rocke, for an house of defence to saue me.
\p
\v 3 For thou art my rocke and my fortresse: therfore for thy names sake lead me, and guide me.
\p
\v 4 Pull me out of the net, that they haue layd priuily for me: for thou art my strength.
\p
\v 5 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed mee, O Lord God of trueth.
\p
\v 6 I haue hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the Lord.
\p
\v 7 I will be glad, and reioyce in thy mercie: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast knowen my soule in aduersities;
\p
\v 8 And hast not shut me vp into the hand of the enemie: thou hast set my feete in a large roome.
\p
\v 9 Haue mercy vpon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; mine eie is consumed with griefe, yea my soule and my belly.
\p
\v 10 For my life is spent with griefe, and my yeeres with sighing: my strength faileth, because of mine iniquitie, and my bones are consumed.
\p
\v 11 I was a reproch among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a feare to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without, fled from me.
\p
\v 12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of minde: I am like a broken vessell.
\p
\v 13 For I haue heard the slaunder of many, feare was on euery side: while they tooke counsell together against me, they deuised to take away my life.
\p
\v 14 But I trusted in thee, O Lord: I sayd, Thou art my God.
\p
\v 15 My times are in thy hand: deliuer me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
\p
\v 16 Make thy face to shine vpon thy seruant: saue me for thy mercies sake.
\p
\v 17 Let mee not be ashamed, O Lord, for I haue called vpon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the graue.
\p
\v 18 Let the lying lippes be put to silence: which speake grieuous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
\p
\v 19 O how great is thy goodnesse, which thou hast layd vp for them that feare thee: which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee, before the sonnes of men!
\p
\v 20 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence, from the pride of man: thou shalt keepe them secretly in a pauilion, from the strife of tongues.
\p
\v 21 Blessed be the Lord; for hee hath shewed me his maruellous kindnesse, in a strong citie.
\p
\v 22 For I sayd in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eies: Neuerthelesse thou heardest the voice of my supplications, when I cryed vnto thee.
\p
\v 23 O loue the Lord, all yee his Saints: for the Lord preserueth the faithfull, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.
\p
\v 24 Be of good courage, and hee shall strenghten your heart: all ye that hope in the Lord.

\c 32
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid, Maschil. Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiuen, whose sinne is couered.
\p
\v 2 Blessed is the man vnto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquitie: and in whose spirit there is no guile.
\p
\v 3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old; through my roaring all the day long.
\p
\v 4 For day and night thy hand was heauy vpon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
\p
\v 5 I acknowledged my sin vnto thee, and mine iniquitie haue I not hid: I said, I will confesse my transgressions vnto the Lord; and thou forgauest the iniquitie of my sinne. Selah.
\p
\v 6 For this shall euery one that is godly pray vnto thee, in a time when thou mayest bee found: surely in the floods of great waters, they shall not come nigh vnto him.
\p
\v 7 Thou art my hiding place, thou shalt preserue mee from trouble: thou shalt compasse me about with songs of deliuerance. Selah.
\p
\v 8 I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou shalt goe: I will guide thee with mine eye.
\p
\v 9 Be yee not as the horse, or as the mule which haue no vnderstanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, least they come neere vnto thee.
\p
\v 10 Many sorrowes shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compasse him about.
\p
\v 11 Be glad in the Lord, and reioyce yee righteous: and shout for ioy all ye that are vpright in heart.

\c 33
\p
\v 1 Reioyce in the Lord, O yee righteous: for prayse is comely for the vpright.
\p
\v 2 Praise the Lord with harp: sing vnto him with the Psalterie, and an instrument of ten strings.
\p
\v 3 Sing vnto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
\p
\v 4 For the word of the Lord is right: and all his workes are done in trueth.
\p
\v 5 Hee loueth righteousnesse and iudgement: the earth is ful of the goodnesse of the Lord.
\p
\v 6 By the word of the Lord were the heauens made: and all the host of them, by the breath of his mouth.
\p
\v 7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as an heape: he layeth vp the depth in storehouses.
\p
\v 8 Let all the earth feare the Lord: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
\p
\v 9 For he spake, and it was done: he commanded, and it stood fast.
\p
\v 10 The Lord bringeth the counsell of the heathen to nought: he maketh the deuices of the people, of none effect.
\p
\v 11 The counsaile of the Lord standeth for euer, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
\p
\v 12 Blessed is the nation, whose God is the Lord: and the people, whom he hath chosen for his owne inheritance.
\p
\v 13 The Lord looketh from heauen: he beholdeth all the sonnes of men.
\p
\v 14 From the place of his habitation, he looketh vpon all the inhabitants of the earth.
\p
\v 15 He fashioneth their hearts alike: he considereth all their workes.
\p
\v 16 There is no king saued by the multitude of an hoste: a mightie man is not deliuered by much strength.
\p
\v 17 An horse is a vaine thing for safetie: neither shall he deliuer any by his great strength.
\p
\v 18 Behold, the eye of the Lord is vpon them that feare him: vpon them that hope in his mercy:
\p
\v 19 To deliuer their soule from death, and to keepe them aliue in famine.
\p
\v 20 Our soule waiteth for the Lord: he is our helpe, and our shield.
\p
\v 21 For our heart shall reioyce in him: because we haue trusted in his holy name.
\p
\v 22 Let thy mercy (O Lord) be vpon vs: according as we hope in thee.

\c 34
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid, when he changed his behauiour before Abimelech: who droue him away & he departed. I will blesse the Lord at all times: his prayse shall continually bee in my mouth.
\p
\v 2 My soule shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall heare thereof, and be glad.
\p
\v 3 O magnifie the Lord with me, and let vs exalt his name together.
\p
\v 4 I sought the Lord, and hee heard me; and deliuered mee from all my feares.
\p
\v 5 They looked vnto him, and were lightned: and their faces were not ashamed.
\p
\v 6 This poore man cried, and the Lord heard him; and saued him out of all his troubles.
\p
\v 7 The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that feare him, and deliuereth them.
\p
\v 8 O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
\p
\v 9 O feare the Lord yee his Saints: for there is no want to them that feare him.
\p
\v 10 The young lyons doe lacke, and suffer hunger: but they that seeke the Lord, shall not want any good thing.
\p
\v 11 Come yee children, hearken vnto me: I will teach you the feare of the Lord.
\p
\v 12 What man is hee that desireth life; and loueth many dayes, that he may see good?
\p
\v 13 Keepe thy tongue from euill, and thy lippes from speaking guile.
\p
\v 14 Depart from euill, and doe good: seeke peace and pursue it.
\p
\v 15 The eies of the Lord are vpon the righteous; and his eares are open vnto their crie.
\p
\v 16 The face of the Lord is against them that doe euill; to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
\p
\v 17 The righteous crie, and the Lord heareth; and deliuereth them out of all their troubles.
\p
\v 18 The Lord is nigh vnto them that are of a broken heart: and saueth such as be of a contrite spirit.
\p
\v 19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord deliuereth him out of them all.
\p
\v 20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.
\p
\v 21 Euill shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shalbe desolate.
\p
\v 22 The Lord redeemech the soule of his seruants: and none of them that trust in him, shalbe desolate.

\c 35
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. Plead my cause (O Lord) with them that striue with mee: fight against them that fight against me.
\p
\v 2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand vp for mine helpe.
\p
\v 3 Draw out also the speare, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say vnto my soule, I am thy saluation.
\p
\v 4 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seeke after my soule: let them be turned backe and brought to confusion, that deuise my hurt.
\p
\v 5 Let them be as chaffe before the wind: and let the Angel of the Lord chase them.
\p
\v 6 Let their way be darke and slippery, and let the Angel of the Lord persecute them.
\p
\v 7 For without cause haue they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they haue digged for my soule.
\p
\v 8 Let destruction come vpon him at vnawares, and let his net that hee hath hid, catch himselfe: into that very destruction let him fall.
\p
\v 9 And my soule shalbe ioyfull in the Lord: it shall reioyce in his saluation.
\p
\v 10 All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like vnto thee which deliuerest the poore from him that is too strong for him, yea the poore and the needy, from him that spoileth him?
\p
\v 11 False witnesses did rise vp they layd to my charge things that I knew not.
\p
\v 12 They rewarded mee euill for good, to the spoiling of my soule.
\p
\v 13 But as for me, when they were sicke, my clothing was sack-cloth: I humbled my soule with fasting, and my prayer returned into mine owne bosome.
\p
\v 14 I behaued my selfe as though he had bene my friend, or brother: I bowed downe heauily, as one that mourneth for his mother.
\p
\v 15 But in mine aduersitie they reioyced, and gathered themselues together: yea, the abiects gathered themselues together against me, & I knew it not, they did teare me, and ceased not,
\p
\v 16 With hypocriticall mockers in feasts: they gnashed vpon mee with their teeth.
\p
\v 17 Lord, how long wilt thou looke on? rescue my soule from their destructions, my darling from the lyons.
\p
\v 18 I will giue thee thankes in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.
\p
\v 19 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully, reioyce ouer me: neither let them winke with the eye, that hate me without a cause.
\p
\v 20 For they speake not peace: but they deuise deceitfull matters against them that are quiet in the land.
\p
\v 21 Yea they opened their mouth wide against me, and saide, Aha, Aha, our eye hath seene it.
\p
\v 22 This thou hast seene (O Lord) keepe not silence: O Lord be not farre from me.
\p
\v 23 Stirre vp thy selfe and awake to my iudgement, euen vnto my cause, my God and my Lord.
\p
\v 24 Iudge me O Lord my God, according to thy righteousnesse, and let them not reioyce ouer me.
\p
\v 25 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we haue it: let them not say, We haue swallowed him vp.
\p
\v 26 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together, that reioyce at mine hurt: let them bee cloathed with shame and dishonour, that magnifie themselues against me.
\p
\v 27 Let them shoute for ioy, and bee glad that fauour my righteous cause: yea let them say continually, Let the Lord bee magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his seruant
\p
\v 28 And my tongue shall speake of thy righteousnesse, and of thy praise all the day long.

\c 36
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician, A Psalme of Dauid, the seruant of the Lord. The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no feare of God before his eyes.
\p
\v 2 For he flatterech himselfe in his owne eyes, vntill his iniquitie be found to be hatefull.
\p
\v 3 The words of his mouth are iniquitie and deceit: he hath left off to bee wise, and to doe good.
\p
\v 4 Hee deuiseth mischiefe vpon his bed, he setteth himselfe in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not euill.
\p
\v 5 Thy mercie (O Lord) is in the heauens; and thy faithfulnesse reacheth vnto the cloudes.
\p
\v 6 Thy righteousnesse is like the great mountaines; thy iudgements are a great deepe; O Lord, thou preseruest man and beast.
\p
\v 7 How excellent is thy louing kindnesse, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust vnder the shadowe of thy wings.
\p
\v 8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatnesse of thy house: and thou shalt make them drinke of the riuer of thy pleasures.
\p
\v 9 For with thee is the fountaine of life: in thy light shall we see light.
\p
\v 10 O continue thy louing kindnesse vnto them that know thee; and thy righteousnesse to the vpright in heart.
\p
\v 11 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remoue me.
\p
\v 12 There are the workers of iniquitie fallen: they are cast downe, and shal not be able to rise.

\c 37
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. Fret not thy selfe because of euill doers, neither bee thou enuious against the workers of iniquitie.
\p
\v 2 For they shall soone be cut downe like the grasse; and wither as the greene herbe.
\p
\v 3 Trust in the Lord, and do good, so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verely thou shalt be fed.
\p
\v 4 Delight thy selfe also in the Lord; and he shall giue thee the desires of thine heart.
\p
\v 5 Commit thy way vnto the Lord: trust also in him, and he shall bring it to passe.
\p
\v 6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousnes as the light, and thy iudgement as the noone day.
\p
\v 7 Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not thy selfe because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked deuices to passe.
\p
\v 8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thy selfe in any wise to doe euill.
\p
\v 9 For euil doers shall be cut off: but those that waite vpon the Lord, they shall inherite the earth.
\p
\v 10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not bee: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.
\p
\v 11 But the meeke shall inherite the earth: and shall delight themselues in the abundance of peace.
\p
\v 12 The wicked plotteth against the iust, and gnasheth vpon him with his teeth.
\p
\v 13 The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is comming.
\p
\v 14 The wicked haue drawen out the sword, and haue bent their bow to cast downe the poore and needy, and to slay such as be of vpright conuersation.
\p
\v 15 Their sword shall enter into their owne heart, and their bowes shall be broken.
\p
\v 16 A little that a righteous man hath, is better then the riches of many wicked.
\p
\v 17 For the armes of the wicked shall be broken: but the Lord vpholdeth the righteous.
\p
\v 18 The Lord knoweth the dayes of the vpright: and their inheritance shall be for euer.
\p
\v 19 They shall not be ashamed in the euill time: and in the dayes of famine they shalbe satisfied.
\p
\v 20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambes: they shall consume: into smoke shall they consume away.
\p
\v 21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not againe: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giueth.
\p
\v 22 For such as be blessed of him, shall inherite the earth: and they that be cursed of him, shalbe cut off.
\p
\v 23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord: and he delighteth in his way.
\p
\v 24 Though hee fall, he shall not be vtterly cast downe: for the Lord vpholdeth him with his hand.
\p
\v 25 I haue bene yong, and now am old; yet haue I not seene the righteous forsaken, nor his seede begging bread.
\p
\v 26 He is euer mercifull, and lendeth: and his seede is blessed.
\p
\v 27 Depart from euill, and doe good; and dwell for euermore.
\p
\v 28 For the Lord loueth iudgement, and forsaketh not his Saints, they are preserued for euer: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
\p
\v 29 The righteous shall inherite the land, and dwell therein for euer.
\p
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisedome; and his tongue talketh of iudgement.
\p
\v 31 The Law of his God is in his heart: none of his steps shall slide.
\p
\v 32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
\p
\v 33 The Lord will not leaue him in his hand, nor condemne him when he is iudged.
\p
\v 34 Wait on the Lord, and keepe his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
\p
\v 35 I haue seene the wicked in great power: and spreading himselfe like a greene bay tree.
\p
\v 36 Yet he passed away, and loe he was not: yea, I sought him, but hee could not be found.
\p
\v 37 Marke the perfect man, and behold the vpright: for the end of that man is peace.
\p
\v 38 But the transgressours shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shalbe cut off.
\p
\v 39 But the saluation of the righteous is of the Lord: he is their strength in the time of trouble.
\p
\v 40 And the Lord shall helpe them and deliuer them: he shall deliuer them from the wicked, and saue them because they trust in him.

\c 38
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid, to bring to remembrance. O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
\p
\v 2 For thine arrowes sticke fast in me; and thy hand presseth me sore.
\p
\v 3 There is no soundnesse in my flesh, because of thine anger: neither is there any rest in my bones, because of my sinne.
\p
\v 4 For mine iniquities are gone ouer mine head: as an heauy burden, they are too heauie for me.
\p
\v 5 My wounds stinke, and are corrupt: because of my foolishnesse.
\p
\v 6 I am troubled, I am bowed downe greatly; I goe mourning all the day long.
\p
\v 7 For my loynes are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundnesse in my flesh.
\p
\v 8 I am feeble and sore broken; I haue roared by reason of the disquietnesse of my heart.
\p
\v 9 Lord, all my desire is before thee: and my groning is not hid from thee.
\p
\v 10 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eies, it also is gone from me.
\p
\v 11 My louers and my friends stand a loofe from my sore: and my kinsmen stand a farre off.
\p
\v 12 They also that seeke after my life, lay snares for me: and they that seeke my hurt, speake mischieuous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.
\p
\v 13 But I, as a deafe man, heard not; and I was as a dumbe man that openeth not his mouth.
\p
\v 14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not; and in whose mouth are no reproofes.
\p
\v 15 For in thee, O Lord, doe I hope: thou wilt heare, O Lord my God.
\p
\v 16 For I said, heare me, least otherwise they should reioyce ouer me: when my foot slippeth, they magnifie themselues against me.
\p
\v 17 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
\p
\v 18 For I will declare mine iniquitie; I will be sory for my sinne.
\p
\v 19 But mine enemies are liuely, and they are strong: and they that hate mee wrongfully, are multiplied.
\p
\v 20 They also that render euill for good, are mine aduersaries: because I follow the thing that good is.
\p
\v 21 Forsake me not, O Lord: O my God, be not farre from me.
\p
\v 22 Make haste to helpe mee, O Lord my saluation.

\c 39
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician, euen to Ieduthun, A Psalme of Dauid. I sayd, I will take heede to my waies, that I sinne not with my tongue: I will keepe my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.
\p
\v 2 I was dumbe with silence, I held my peace, euen from good, and my sorrow was stirred.
\p
\v 3 My heart was hot within mee, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue.
\p
\v 4 Lord, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my dayes, what it is: that I may know how fraile I am.
\p
\v 5 Behold, thou hast made my dayes as an hand breadth, and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily euery man at his best state is altogether vanitie. Selah.
\p
\v 6 Surely euery man walketh in a vaine shew: surely they are disquieted in vaine: he heapeth vp riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
\p
\v 7 And now Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.
\p
\v 8 Deliuer me from all my transgressions: make mee not the reproch of the foolish.
\p
\v 9 I was dumbe, I opened not my mouth; because thou diddest it.
\p
\v 10 Remooue thy stroke away from mee: I am consumed by the blowe of thine hand.
\p
\v 11 When thou with rebukes doest correct man for iniquitie, thou makest his beautie to consume away like a moth: surely euery man is vanitie. Selah.
\p
\v 12 Heare my prayer, O Lord, and giue eare vnto my crie, hold not thy peace at my teares: for I am a straunger with thee, and a soiourner, as all my fathers were.
\p
\v 13 O spare me, that I may recouer strength: before I goe hence, and be no more.

\c 40
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician, A Psalme of Dauid. I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined vnto me, and heard my crie.
\p
\v 2 He brought me vp also out of an horrible pit, out of the mirie clay, and set my feete vpon a rock, and established my goings.
\p
\v 3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, euen praise vnto our God: many shall see it, and feare, and shall trust in the Lord.
\p
\v 4 Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his truste: and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turne aside to lies.
\p
\v 5 Many, O Lord my God; are thy wonderfull workes which thou hast done, and thy thoughts, which are to vs ward: they cannot be reckoned vp in order vnto thee: if I would declare and speake of them, they are moe then can be numbred.
\p
\v 6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire, mine eares hast thou opened: burnt offering and sinne-offering hast thou not required.
\p
\v 7 Then sayd I, Loe, I come: in the volume of the booke it is written of me:
\p
\v 8 I delight to doe thy will, O my God: yea thy lawe is within my heart.
\p
\v 9 I haue preached righteousnesse in the great congregation: loe, I haue not refrained my lippes, O Lord, thou knowest.
\p
\v 10 I haue not hid thy righteousnesse within my heart, I haue declared thy faithfulnesse and thy saluation: I haue not concealed thy louing kindnesse, and thy truth, from the great congregation.
\p
\v 11 With-hold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord: let thy louing kindnesse, and thy trueth continually preserue me.
\p
\v 12 For innumerable euils haue compassed me about, mine iniquities haue taken hold vpon me, so that I am not able to looke vp: they are moe then the haires of mine head, therefore my heart faileth me.
\p
\v 13 Be pleased, O Lord, to deliuer me: O Lord, make haste to helpe me.
\p
\v 14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together, that seeke after my soule to destroy it: let them be driuen backward, and put to shame, that wish me euill.
\p
\v 15 Let them be desolate, for a reward on their shame, that say vnto me, Aha, aha!
\p
\v 16 Let all those that seeke thee, reioyce and bee glad in thee: let such as loue thy saluation, say continually, The Lord be magnified.
\p
\v 17 But I am poore and needy, yet the Lord thinketh vpon me: thou art my helpe and my deliuerer, make no tarrying, O my God.

\c 41
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician. A Psalme of Dauid. Blessed is he that considereth the poore; the Lord will deliuer him in time of trouble.
\p
\v 2 The Lord will preserue him, and keepe him aliue, and he shall be blessed vpon the earth; and thou wilt not deliuer him vnto the will of his enemies.
\p
\v 3 The Lord will strengthen him vpon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sicknesse.
\p
\v 4 I sayd, Lord be mercifull vnto me, heale my soule, for I haue sinned against thee.
\p
\v 5 Mine enemies speake euill of me: when shall hee die, and his name perish?
\p
\v 6 And if hee come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquitie to it selfe, when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.
\p
\v 7 All that hate me, whisper together against me; against me doe they deuise my hurt.
\p
\v 8 An euill disease, say they, cleaueth fast vnto him; and now that he lyeth, he shall rise vp no more.
\p
\v 9 Yea mine owne familiar friend in whom I trusted, which did eate of my bread, hath lift vp his heele against me.
\p
\v 10 But thou, O Lord, be mercifull vnto mee, and raise me up vp that I may requite them.
\p
\v 11 By this I know that thou fauourest me: because mine enemie doeth not triumph ouer me.
\p
\v 12 And as for me, thou vpholdest me in mine integritie; and settest me before thy face for euer.
\p
\v 13 Blessed bee the Lord God of Israel, from euerlasting, and to euerlasting. Amen, and Amen.

\c 42
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician, Maschil, for the sonnes of Korah. As the Hart panteth after the water brookes, so panteth my soule after thee, O God.
\p
\v 2 My soule thirsteth for God, for the liuing God: when shall I come and appeare before God?
\p
\v 3 My teares haue bene my meate day and night; while they continually say vnto me, Where is thy God?
\p
\v 4 When I remember these things, I powre out my soule in mee; for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God; with the voyce of ioy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy day.
\p
\v 5 Why art thou cast downe, O my soule, and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him for the helpe of his countenance.
\p
\v 6 O my God, my soule is cast downe within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Iordane, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Missar.
\p
\v 7 Deepe calleth vnto deepe at the noyse of thy water-spouts: all thy waues, and thy billowes are gone ouer me.
\p
\v 8 Yet the Lord will command his louing kindnes in the day time, and in the night his song shalbe with me, and my prayer vnto the God of my life.
\p
\v 9 I will say vnto God, My rocke, why hast thou forgotten me? why goe I mourning, because of the oppression of the enemy?
\p
\v 10 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproch mee: while they say dayly vnto me, Where is thy God?
\p
\v 11 Why art thou cast downe, O my soule? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.

\c 43
\p
\v 1 Iudge mee, O God, and plead my cause against an vngodly nation; O deliuer me from the deceitfull and vniust man.
\p
\v 2 For thou art the God of my strength, why doest thou cast me off? why goe I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
\p
\v 3 O send out thy light & thy trueth; let them leade mee, let them bring mee vnto thy holy hill, and to thy Tabernacles.
\p
\v 4 Then will I goe vnto the Altar of God, vnto God my exceeding ioy: yea vpon the harpe will I praise thee, O God, my God.
\p
\v 5 Why art thou cast downe, O my soule? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God, for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.

\c 44
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician for the sonnes of Korah. Wee haue heard with our eares, O God, our fathers haue told vs, what worke thou didst in their dayes, in the times of old.
\p
\v 2 How thou didst driue out the heathen with thy hand, & plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
\p
\v 3 For they got not the land in possession by their owne sword, neither did their owne arme saue them: but thy right hand, and thine arme, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a fauour vnto them.
\p
\v 4 Thou art my King, O God: command deliuerances for Iacob.
\p
\v 5 Through thee will wee push downe our enemies: through thy Name will wee tread them vnder that rise vp against vs.
\p
\v 6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword saue me.
\p
\v 7 But thou hast saued vs from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated vs.
\p
\v 8 In God we boast all the day long: and praise thy Name for euer. Selah.
\p
\v 9 But thou hast cast off and put vs to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.
\p
\v 10 Thou makest vs to turne backe from the enemie: and they which hate vs, spoile for themselues.
\p
\v 11 Thou hast giuen vs like sheepe appointed for meate: and hast scattered vs among the heathen.
\p
\v 12 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and doest not increase thy wealth by their price.
\p
\v 13 Thou makest vs a reproch to our neighbours, a scorne and a derision to them that are round about vs.
\p
\v 14 Thou makest vs a by-word among the heathen: a shaking of the head among the people.
\p
\v 15 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath couered me.
\p
\v 16 For the voice of him that reproacheth, and blasphemeth: by reason of the enemie and auenger.
\p
\v 17 All this is come vpon vs; yet haue wee not forgotten thee, neither haue we dealt falsly in thy couenant.
\p
\v 18 Our heart is not turned backe: neither haue our steps declined from thy way,
\p
\v 19 Though thou hast sore broken vs in the place of dragons, and couered vs with the shadow of death.
\p
\v 20 If wee haue forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange God:
\p
\v 21 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
\p
\v 22 Yea for thy sake are wee killed all the day long: wee are counted as sheepe for the slaughter.
\p
\v 23 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast vs not off for euer.
\p
\v 24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face? and forgettest our affliction, and our oppression?
\p
\v 25 For our soule is bowed downe to the dust; our belly cleaueth vnto the earth.
\p
\v 26 Arise for our helpe, and redeeme vs for thy mercies sake.

\c 45
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician vpon Shoshannim, for the sonnes of Korah, Maschil: a song of loues. My heart is inditing a good matter: I speake of the things which I haue made, touching the King: my tongue is the penne of a ready writer.
\p
\v 2 Thou art fairer then the children of men: grace is powred into thy lips: therfore God hath blessed thee for euer.
\p
\v 3 Gird thy sword vpon thy thigh, O most mightie: with thy glory and thy maiestie.
\p
\v 4 And in thy maiestie ride prosperously, because of trueth and meekenes, and righteousnesse: and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
\p
\v 5 Thine arrowes are sharpe in the heart of the Kings enemies; whereby the people fall vnder thee.
\p
\v 6 Thy throne (O God) is for euer and euer: the scepter of thy kingdome is a right scepter.
\p
\v 7 Thou louest righteousnesse, and hatest wickednesse: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oyle of gladnesse aboue thy fellowes.
\p
\v 8 All thy garments smell of myrrhe, and aloes, and cassia: out of the Iuorie palaces, whereby they haue made thee glad.
\p
\v 9 Kings daughters were among thy honourable women: vpon thy right hand did stand the Queene in golde of Ophir.
\p
\v 10 Hearken (O daughter) and consider, and incline thine eare; forget also thine owne people, and thy fathers house.
\p
\v 11 So shall the king greatly desire thy beautie: for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him.
\p
\v 12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift, euen the rich among the people shall intreate thy fauour.
\p
\v 13 The kings daughter is all glorious within; her clothing is of wrought gold.
\p
\v 14 She shall bee brought vnto the king in raiment of needle worke: the virgins her companions that followe her, shall be brought vnto thee.
\p
\v 15 With gladnesse and reioycing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the kings palace.
\p
\v 16 In stead of thy fathers shall bee thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.
\p
\v 17 I will make thy name to bee remembred in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for euer and euer.

\c 46
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician for the sonnes of Korah, a song vpon Alamoth. God is our refuge and strength: a very present helpe in trouble.
\p
\v 2 Therfore will not we feare, though the earth be remoued: and though the mountaines be caried into the midst of the sea.
\p
\v 3 Though the waters thereof roare, and be troubled, though the mountaines shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.
\p
\v 4 There is a riuer, the streames wherof shall make glad the citie of God: the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most High.
\p
\v 5 God is in the midst of her: she shal not be moued; God shall helpe her, and that right early.
\p
\v 6 The heathen raged, the kingdomes were mooued: he vttered his voyce, the earth melted.
\p
\v 7 The Lord of hosts is with vs; the God of Iacob is our refuge. Selah.
\p
\v 8 Come, behold the workes of the Lord, what desolations hee hath made in the earth.
\p
\v 9 He maketh warres to cease vnto the end of the earth: hee breaketh the bow, and cutteth the speare in sunder, he burneth the chariot in the fire.
\p
\v 10 Be stil, and know that I am God: I will bee exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
\p
\v 11 The Lord of hosts is with vs; the God of Iacob is our refuge. Selah.

\c 47
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician, a psalme for the sonnes of Korah. O Clap your hands (all ye people:) shoute vnto God with the voyce of triumph:
\p
\v 2 For the Lord most high is terrible; he is a great King ouer all the earth.
\p
\v 3 Hee shall subdue the people vnder vs, and the nations vnder our feet.
\p
\v 4 He shall chuse our inheritance for vs, the excellencie of Iacob whom hee loued. Selah.
\p
\v 5 God is gone vp with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.
\p
\v 6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises vnto our King, sing praises.
\p
\v 7 For God is the King of all the earth, sing ye praises with vnderstanding.
\p
\v 8 God reigneth ouer the heathen: God sitteth vpon the throne of his holinesse.
\p
\v 9 The princes of the people are gathered together, euen the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong vnto God: hee is greatly exalted.

\c 48
\p
\v 1 A song, and Psalme for the sonnes of Korah. Great is the Lord, and greatly to bee praised in the citie of our God, in the mountaine of his holinesse.
\p
\v 2 Beautifull for situation, the ioy of the whole earth is mo&#363;t Sion, on the sides of the North, the citie of the great King.
\p
\v 3 God is knowen in her palaces for a refuge.
\p
\v 4 For loe, the kings were assembled: they passed by together.
\p
\v 5 They sawe it, and so they marueiled, they were troubled and hasted away.
\p
\v 6 Feare tooke holde vpon them there, and paine, as of a woman in trauaile.
\p
\v 7 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an East wind.
\p
\v 8 As we haue heard, so haue wee seene in the citie of the Lord of hosts, in the citie of our God, God will establish it for euer. Selah,
\p
\v 9 Wee haue thought of thy louing kindnesse, O God, in the middest of thy Temple.
\p
\v 10 According to thy Name, O God, so is thy praise vnto the endes of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousnesse.
\p
\v 11 Let mount Sion reioyce, let the daughters of Iudah be glad, because of thy iudgements.
\p
\v 12 Walke about Sion, and goe round about her: tell the towres thereof.
\p
\v 13 Marke yee well her bulwarkes, consider her palaces; that yee may tell it to the generation following.
\p
\v 14 For this God is our God for euer, and euer; he will be our guide euen vnto death.

\c 49
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician, a Psalme for the sonnes of Korah. Heare this, all yee people, giue eare all yee inhabitants of the world:
\p
\v 2 Both low, and high, rich and poore together.
\p
\v 3 My mouth shall speake of wisedome: and the meditation of my heart shalbe of vnderstanding.
\p
\v 4 I will incline mine eare to a parable; I will open my darke saying vpon the harpe.
\p
\v 5 Wherefore should I feare in the daies of euill, when the iniquitie of my heeles shall compasse me about?
\p
\v 6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselues in the multitude of their riches:
\p
\v 7 None of them can by any meanes redeeme his brother, nor giue to God a ransome for him:
\p
\v 8 (For the redemption of their soule is precious, and it ceaseth for euer.)
\p
\v 9 That he should still liue for euer, and not see corruption.
\p
\v 10 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the foole, and the brutish person perish, and leaue their wealth to others.
\p
\v 11 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for euer, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their owne names.
\p
\v 12 Neuerthelesse man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beastes that perish.
\p
\v 13 This their way is their follie; yet their posteritie approue their sayings. Selah.
\p
\v 14 Like sheepe they are layd in the graue, death shall feede on them; and the vpright shall haue dominion ouer them in the morning, and their beauty shall consume in the graue, from their dwelling.
\p
\v 15 But God will redeeme my soule from the power of the graue; for he shall receiue me. Selah.
\p
\v 16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased.
\p
\v 17 For when he dieth, he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
\p
\v 18 Though whiles he liued, he blessed his soule: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thy selfe.
\p
\v 19 Hee shall goe to the generation of his fathers, they shall neuer see light.
\p
\v 20 Man that is in honour and vnderstandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.

\c 50
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Asaph. The mightie God, euen the Lord hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sunne, vnto the going downe thereof.
\p
\v 2 Out of Sion the perfection of beautie, God hath shined.
\p
\v 3 Our God shall come, and shall not keepe silence: a fire shall deuoure before him, and it shalbe very tempestuous round about him.
\p
\v 4 He shall call to the heauens from aboue, and to the earth, that hee may iudge his people.
\p
\v 5 Gather my Saints together vnto mee: those that haue made a couenant with me, by sacrifice.
\p
\v 6 And the heauens shall declare his righteousnes; for God is iudge himselfe. Selah.
\p
\v 7 Heare, O my people, and I will speake, O Israel, and I will testifie against thee; I am God, euen thy God.
\p
\v 8 I will not reproue thee for thy sacrifices, or thy burnt offerings, to haue bene continually before me.
\p
\v 9 I will take no bullocke out of thy house, nor hee goates out of thy folds.
\p
\v 10 For euery beast of the forrest is mine, and the cattell vpon a thousand hilles.
\p
\v 11 I know all the foules of the mountaines: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.
\p
\v 12 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee, for the world is mine, and the fulnesse thereof.
\p
\v 13 Will I eate the flesh of bulles, or drinke the blood of goats?
\p
\v 14 Offer vnto God thankesgiuing, and pay thy vowes vnto the most high.
\p
\v 15 And call vpon mee in the day of trouble; I will deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.
\p
\v 16 But vnto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to doe, to declare my Statutes, or that thou shouldest take my Couenant in thy mouth?
\p
\v 17 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behinde thee.
\p
\v 18 When thou sawest a thiefe, then thou consentedst with him, and hast bene partaker with adulterers.
\p
\v 19 Thou giuest thy mouth to euill, and thy tongue frameth deceit.
\p
\v 20 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine owne mothers sonne.
\p
\v 21 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence: thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thy selfe: but I will reproue thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.
\p
\v 22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I teare you in pieces, and there be none to deliuer.
\p
\v 23 Who so offereth praise, glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conuersation aright, will I shew the saluation of God.

\c 51
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician. A Psalme of Dauid, when Nathan the Prophet came vnto him, after hee had gone in to Bath-sheba. Haue mercie vpon mee, O God, according to thy louing kindnesse: according vnto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
\p
\v 2 Wash mee throughly from mine iniquitie, and clense me from my sinne.
\p
\v 3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sinne is euer before mee.
\p
\v 4 Against thee, thee onely haue I sinned, and done this euill in thy sight: that thou mightest bee iustified when thou speakest, and be cleare when thou iudgest.
\p
\v 5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquitie: and in sinne did my mother conceiue me.
\p
\v 6 Behold, thou desirest trueth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisedome.
\p
\v 7 Purge me with hyssope, and I shalbe cleane: wash me, and I shall be whiter then snow.
\p
\v 8 Make mee to heare ioy and gladnesse: that the bones which thou hast broken, may reioyce.
\p
\v 9 Hide thy face from my sinnes; and blot out all mine iniquities.
\p
\v 10 Create in mee a cleane heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within mee.
\p
\v 11 Cast mee not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
\p
\v 12 Restore vnto me the ioy of thy saluation: and vphold mee with thy free Spirit.
\p
\v 13 Then will I teach transgressours thy wayes, and sinners shalbe conuerted vnto thee.
\p
\v 14 Deliuer mee from blood-guiltinesse, O God, thou God of my saluation: and my tongue shall sing alowd of thy righteousnesse.
\p
\v 15 O Lord open thou my lips, and my mouth shall shew foorth thy praise.
\p
\v 16 For thou desirest not sacrifice: else would I giue it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.
\p
\v 17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
\p
\v 18 Doe good in thy good pleasure vnto Sion: build thou the walles of Ierusalem.
\p
\v 19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousnesse, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullockes vpon thine altar.

\c 52
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician, Maschil, A Psalme of Dauid: When Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said vnto him, Dauid is come to the house of Ahimelech. Why boastest thou thy selfe in mischiefe, O mightie man? the goodnesse of God indureth continually.
\p
\v 2 Thy tongue deuiseth mischiefes: like a sharpe rasor, working deceitfully.
\p
\v 3 Thou louest euill more then good; and lying rather then to speake righteousnesse. Selah.
\p
\v 4 Thou louest all deuouring words, O thou deceitfull tongue.
\p
\v 5 God shall likewise destroy thee for euer, hee shall take thee away and plucke thee out of thy dwelling place, and roote thee out of the land of the liuing. Selah.
\p
\v 6 The righteous also shall see, and feare, and shall laugh at him.
\p
\v 7 Loe, this is the man that made not God his strength: but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himselfe in his wickednesse.
\p
\v 8 But I am like a greene oliue tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for euer and euer.
\p
\v 9 I will prayse thee for euer, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name, for it is good before thy Saints.

\c 53
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician vpon Mahalath, Maschil, A Psalme of Dauid. The foole hath sayde in his heart, There is no god; Corrupt are they, and haue done abhominable iniquitie; there is none that doth good.
\p
\v 2 God looked downe from heauen vpon the children of men, to see if there were any that did vnderstand, that did seeke God.
\p
\v 3 Euery one of them is gone backe, they are altogether become filthy: there is none that doth good, no not one.
\p
\v 4 Haue the workers of iniquitie no knowledge? who eate vp my people, as they eate bread; they haue not called vpon God.
\p
\v 5 There were they in great feare, where no feare was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that incampeth against thee, thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.
\p
\v 6 O that the saluation of Israel were come out of Sion! when God bringeth backe the captiuitie of his people, Iaakob shall reioyce, and Israel shall be glad.

\c 54
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A Psalme of Dauid. When the Ziphims came and sayde to Saul: doeth not Dauid hide himselfe with vs? Saue me, O God, by thy name, and iudge me by thy strength.
\p
\v 2 Heare my prayer, O God; giue eare to the words of my mouth.
\p
\v 3 For strangers are risen vp against me, and oppressors seeke after my soule; they haue not set God before them. Selah.
\p
\v 4 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that vphold my soule.
\p
\v 5 He shall reward euill vnto mine enemies: cut them off in thy trueth.
\p
\v 6 I will freely sacrifice vnto thee; I will praise thy name (O Lord:) for it is good.
\p
\v 7 For hee hath deliuered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seene his desire vpon mine enemies.

\c 55
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician on Neginoth, Maschil. A Psalme of Dauid. Giue eare to my prayer, O God: and hide not thy selfe from my supplication.
\p
\v 2 Attend vnto me, and heare me: I mourne in my complaint, and make a noise.
\p
\v 3 Because of the voyce of the enemie, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquitie vpon me, and in wrath they hate me.
\p
\v 4 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrours of death are fallen vpon me.
\p
\v 5 Fearefulnesse and trembling are come vpon me, and horrour hath ouerwhelmed me.
\p
\v 6 And I said, O that I had wings like a doue; for then would I flee away and be at rest.
\p
\v 7 Loe, then would I wander farre off, and remaine in the wildernesse. Selah.
\p
\v 8 I would hasten my escape from the windie storme, and tempest.
\p
\v 9 Destroy, O Lord, and diuide their tongues: for I haue seene violence and strife in the citie.
\p
\v 10 Day and night they goe about it vpon the walles thereof: mischiefe also and sorrow are in the midst of it.
\p
\v 11 Wickednesse is in the midst thereof: deceite and guile depart not from her streets.
\p
\v 12 For it was not an enemie that reproached me, then I could haue borne it, neither was it hee that hated me, that did magnifie himselfe against me, then I would haue hid my selfe from him.
\p
\v 13 But it was thou, a man, mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.
\p
\v 14 Wee tooke sweet counsell together, and walked vnto the house of God in companie.
\p
\v 15 Let death seaze vpon them, and let them goe downe quicke into hell: for wickednes is in their dwellings, and among them.
\p
\v 16 As for me, I will call vpon God: and the Lord shall saue me.
\p
\v 17 Euening and morning, and at noone will I pray, and crie aloud: and he shall heare my voyce.
\p
\v 18 He hath deliuered my soule in peace from the battell that was against me: for there were many with me.
\p
\v 19 God shall heare and afflict them, euen he that abideth of old, Selah: because they haue no changes, therefore they feare not God.
\p
\v 20 He hath put foorth his handes against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his couenant.
\p
\v 21 The words of his mouth were smoother then butter, but warre was in his heart: his words were softer then oyle, yet were they drawen swords.
\p
\v 22 Cast thy burden vpon the Lord, and he shall sustaine thee: hee shall neuer suffer the righteous to bee moued.
\p
\v 23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them downe into the pit of destruction: Bloody and deceitfull men shall not liue out halfe their dayes, but I will trust in thee.

\c 56
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician vpon Ionath Elem Rechokim, Michtam of Dauid, when the Philistines tooke him in Gath. Be mercifull vnto mee, O God, for man would swallow me vp: he fighting daily, oppresseth me.
\p
\v 2 Mine enemies would dayly swallow me vp: for they bee many that fight against me, O thou most high.
\p
\v 3 What time I am afraide, I will trust in thee.
\p
\v 4 In God I will praise his worde, In God I haue put my trust, I will not feare what flesh can doe vnto me.
\p
\v 5 Euery day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against mee for euill.
\p
\v 6 They gather themselues together; they hide themselues, they marke my steps when they wait for my soule.
\p
\v 7 Shall they escape by iniquitie? in thine anger cast downe the people, O God.
\p
\v 8 Thou tellest my wanderings, put thou my teares into thy bottle: are they not in thy booke?
\p
\v 9 When I crie vnto thee, then shall mine enemies turne backe: this I know, for God is for me.
\p
\v 10 In God will I praise his word: in the Lord will I praise his word.
\p
\v 11 In God haue I put my trust: I will not bee afraid what man can doe vnto me.
\p
\v 12 Thy vowes are vpon me, O God: I will render praises vnto thee.
\p
\v 13 For thou hast deliuered my soule from death: wilt not thou deliuer my feet from falling? that I may walke before God in the light of the liuing.

\c 57
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician Al-taschith, Michtam of Dauid, when hee fled from Saul in the caue. Be mercifull vnto mee, O God, be merciful vnto me, for my soule trusteth in thee: yea in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, vntill these calamities bee ouerpast.
\p
\v 2 I will crie vnto God most high: vnto God that perfourmeth all things for mee.
\p
\v 3 Hee shall send from heauen, and saue me from the reproch of him, that would swallow me vp; Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his trueth.
\p
\v 4 My soule is among lyons, and I lie euen among them that are set on fire: euen the sonnes of men, whose teeth are speares and arrowes, and their tongue a sharpe sword.
\p
\v 5 Be thou exalted, O God, aboue the heauens: let thy glory be aboue all the earth.
\p
\v 6 They haue prepared a net for my steppes, my soule is bowed downe: they haue digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselues. Selah.
\p
\v 7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, and giue praise.
\p
\v 8 Awake vp my glory, awake psalterie and harpe; I my selfe will awake early.
\p
\v 9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people; I will sing vnto thee among the nations.
\p
\v 10 For thy mercy is great vnto the heauens, and thy trueth vnto the clouds.
\p
\v 11 Be thou exalted, O God, aboue the heauens: let thy glory be aboue all the earth.

\c 58
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician Al-taschith, Michtam of Dauid. Doe yee indeed speake righteousnesse, O congregation? doe ye iudge vprightly, O ye sonnes of men?
\p
\v 2 Yea, in heart you worke wickednesse; you waigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
\p
\v 3 The wicked are estranged from the wombe, they goe astray as soone as they be borne, speaking lies.
\p
\v 4 Their poison is like the poyson of a serpent; they are like the deafe adder that stoppeth her eare:
\p
\v 5 Which will not hearken to the voyce of charmers, charming neuer so wisely.
\p
\v 6 Breake their teeth, O God, in their mouth: breake out the great teeth of the young lyons, O Lord.
\p
\v 7 Let them melt away as waters, which runne continually: When he bendeth his bow to shoote his arrowes, let them be as cut in pieces.
\p
\v 8 As a snaile which melteth, let euery one of them passe away: like the vntimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sunne.
\p
\v 9 Before your pots can feele the thornes, he shall take them away as with a whirlewind, both liuing, and in his wrath.
\p
\v 10 The righteous shall reioyce when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feete in the blood of the wicked.
\p
\v 11 So that a man shall say, Uerily there is a reward for the righteous: verily hee is a God that iudgeth in the earth.

\v 1 To the chiefe musician Al-taschith, Michtam of Dauid: when Saul sent, and they watcht the house to kill him. Deliuer me from mine enemies, O my God: defend mee from them that rise vp against me.
\p
\v 2 Deliuer mee from the workers of iniquitie, and saue me from bloodie men.
\p
\v 3 For loe, they lye in waite for my soule; the mighty are gathered against me, not for my transgression, nor for my sinne, O Lord.
\p
\v 4 They runne and prepare themselues without my fault: awake to helpe me, and behold.
\p
\v 5 Thou therefore, O Lord God of hostes, the God of Israel, awake to visite all the heathen: be not mercifull to any wicked transgressours. Selah.
\p
\v 6 They returne at euening: they make a noise like a dogge, and go round about the citie.
\p
\v 7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lippes; for who, say they, doeth heare?
\p
\v 8 But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt haue all the heathen in derision.
\p
\v 9 Because of his strength will I wait vpon thee: for God is my defence.
\p
\v 10 The God of my mercy shall preuent me; God shall let mee see my desire vpon mine enemies.
\p
\v 11 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them downe, O Lord our shield.
\p
\v 12 For the sinne of their mouth, and the words of their lips, let them euen be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speake.
\p
\v 13 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Iacob, vnto the ends of the earth. Selah.
\p
\v 14 And at euening let them returne, and let them make a noise like a dogge, and goe round about the citie.
\p
\v 15 Let them wander vp and downe for meate, and grudge if they be not satisfied.
\p
\v 16 But I will sing of thy power; yea I will sing alowd of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast bene my defence and refuge, in the day of my trouble.
\p
\v 17 Vnto thee, O my strength, wil I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.

\c 60
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician vpon Shushan-Eduth Michtam of Dauid, to teach. When hee stroue with Aram Naharaim, and with Aram Zobah, when Ioab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt, twelue thousand. O God, thou hast cast vs off; thou hast scattered vs, thou hast bene displeased, O turne thy selfe to vs againe.
\p
\v 2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heale the breaches thereof, for it shaketh.
\p
\v 3 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made vs to drinke the wine of astonishment.
\p
\v 4 Thou hast giuen a banner to them that feare thee: that it may be displayed because of the trueth. Selah.
\p
\v 5 That thy beloued may be deliuered; saue with thy right hand, and heare mee.
\p
\v 6 God hath spoken in his holinesse, I wil reioyce: I will diuide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
\p
\v 7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Iudah is my Lawgiuer.
\p
\v 8 Moab is my wash-pot, ouer Edom wil I cast out my shooe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.
\p
\v 9 Who wil bring me into the strong citie? who will lead me into Edom?
\p
\v 10 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast vs off? and thou, O God, which didst not goe out with our armies.
\p
\v 11 Giue vs helpe from trouble: for vaine is the helpe of man.
\p
\v 12 Through God wee shall doe valiantly: for he it is that shall tread downe our enemies.

\c 61
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician vpon Neginah. A Psalme of Dauid. Heare my cry, O God, attend vnto my prayer.
\p
\v 2 From the end of the earth wil I cry vnto thee, when my heart is ouerwhelmed: leade me to the rocke, that is higher then I.
\p
\v 3 For thou hast bene a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.
\p
\v 4 I will abide in thy Tabernacle for euer: I will trust in the couert of thy wings. Selah.
\p
\v 5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vowes: thou hast giuen me the heritage of those that feare thy name.
\p
\v 6 Thou wilt prolong the kings life: and his yeeres as many generations.
\p
\v 7 He shall abide before God for euer: O prepare mercy and trueth which may preserue him.
\p
\v 8 So will I sing praise vnto thy name for euer, that I may daily performe my vowes.

\c 62
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician, to Ieduthun, A Psalme of Dauid. Truely my soule waiteth vpon God: from him commeth my saluation.
\p
\v 2 He onely is my rocke and my saluation: he is my defence, I shall not be greatly moued.
\p
\v 3 How long wil ye imagine mischiefe against a man? ye shall be slaine all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.
\p
\v 4 They onely consult to cast him downe from his excellency, they delight in lies: they blesse with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.
\p
\v 5 My soule, wait thou onely vpon God: for my expectation is from him.
\p
\v 6 He onely is my rocke and my saluation; he is my defence; I shall not bee moued.
\p
\v 7 In God is my saluation, and my glorie: the rocke of my strength, and my refuge is in God.
\p
\v 8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, powre out your heart before him: God is a refuge for vs. Selah.
\p
\v 9 Surely men of low degree are vanitie, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the ballance, they are altogether lighter then vanitie.
\p
\v 10 Trust not in oppression, become not vaine in robberie: if riches increase, set not your heart vpon them.
\p
\v 11 God hath spoken once; twice haue I heard this, that power belongeth vnto God.
\p
\v 12 Also vnto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercie: for thou renderest to euery man according to his worke.

\c 63
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid, when hee was in the wildernesse of Iudah. O God, thou art my God, earely will I seeke thee: my soule thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, in a drie and thirstie lande, where no water is:
\p
\v 2 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I haue seen thee in the Sanctuary.
\p
\v 3 Because thy louing kindnes is better then life: my lips shal praise thee.
\p
\v 4 Thus will I blesse thee, while I liue: I will lift vp my handes in thy Name.
\p
\v 5 My soule shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatnesse: and my mouth shall praise thee with ioyfull lips:
\p
\v 6 When I remember thee vpon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.
\p
\v 7 Because thou hast bene my helpe; therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I reioyce.
\p
\v 8 My soule followeth hard after thee: thy right hand vpholdeth me.
\p
\v 9 But those that seeke my soule to destroy it, shall goe into the lower parts of the earth.
\p
\v 10 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.
\p
\v 11 But the King shal reioyce in God; euery one that sweareth by him shall glorie: but the mouth of them that speake lies, shall be stopped.

\c 64
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician, a Psalme of Dauid. Heare my voice, O God, in my praier; preserue my life from feare of the enemie.
\p
\v 2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked: from the insurrection of the workers of iniquitie:
\p
\v 3 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bowes to shoote their arrowes, euen bitter words:
\p
\v 4 That they may shoote in secret at the perfect: suddenly doe they shoote at him, and feare not.
\p
\v 5 They incourage themselues in an euill matter: they commune of laying snares priuily; they say, Who shall see them?
\p
\v 6 They search out iniquities, they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of euery one of them, and the heart, is deepe.
\p
\v 7 But God shall shoote at them: with an arrowe, sodenly shall they be wounded.
\p
\v 8 So they shall make their owne tongue to fall vpon themselues: all that see them, shall flee away.
\p
\v 9 And all men shall feare, and shall declare the worke of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.
\p
\v 10 The righteous shalbe glad in the Lord, and shall trust in him; and all the vpright in heart shall glory.

\c 65
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician, a Psalme and song of Dauid. Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and vnto thee shall the vowe be performed.
\p
\v 2 O thou that hearest prayer, vnto thee shall all flesh come.
\p
\v 3 Iniquities preuaile against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.
\p
\v 4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest and causest to approach vnto thee, that hee may dwell in thy Courts: we shalbe satisfied with the goodnesse of thy house, euen of thy holy temple.
\p
\v 5 By terrible things in righteousnesse, wilt thou answere vs, O God of our saluation: who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are a farre off vpon the sea.
\p
\v 6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountaines; being girded with power.
\p
\v 7 Which stilleth the noise of the seas; the noise of their waues, and the tumult of the people.
\p
\v 8 They also that dwell in the vttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning, and euening to reioyce.
\p
\v 9 Thou visitest the earth and waterest it: thou greatly inrichest it with the riuer of God which is full of water; thou preparest them corne, when thou hast so prouided for it.
\p
\v 10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrowes thereof: thou makest it soft with showres, thou blessest the springing thereof.
\p
\v 11 Thou crownest the yeere with thy goodnesse; and thy paths drop fatnesse.
\p
\v 12 They drop vpon the pastures of the wildernesse; and the little hilles reioyce on euery side.
\p
\v 13 The pastures are cloathed with flockes; the valleis also are couered ouer with corne; they shout for ioy, they also sing.

\c 66
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician, a song or Psalme. Make a ioyfull noise vnto God, all yee lands.
\p
\v 2 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.
\p
\v 3 Say vnto God, How terrible art thou in thy workes? through the greatnesse of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselues vnto thee.
\p
\v 4 All the earth shall worship thee; and shall sing vnto thee, they shall sing to thy name; Selah.
\p
\v 5 Come and see the workes of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
\p
\v 6 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foote, there did we reioyce in him.
\p
\v 7 He ruleth by his power for euer, his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselues. Selah.
\p
\v 8 O blesse our God, yee people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard.
\p
\v 9 Which holdeth our soule in life, and suffereth not our feete to be moued.
\p
\v 10 For thou, O God, hast proued vs: thou hast tried vs, as siluer is tryed.
\p
\v 11 Thou broughtest vs into the net; thou layedst affliction vpon our loynes.
\p
\v 12 Thou hast caused men to ride ouer our heads, we went through fire, and through water: but thou broughtest vs out into a wealthy place.
\p
\v 13 I will goe into thy house, with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vowes,
\p
\v 14 Which my lips haue vttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.
\p
\v 15 I will offer vnto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rammes: I will offer bullockes with goates. Selah.
\p
\v 16 Come and heare all ye that feare God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soule.
\p
\v 17 I cried vnto him with my mouth: and he was extolled with my tongue.
\p
\v 18 If I regard iniquitie in my heart: the Lord will not heare me.
\p
\v 19 But verily God hath heard mee; hee hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
\p
\v 20 Blessed bee God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercie from me.

\c 67
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician on Neginoth. A Psalme or song. God be mercifull vnto vs, and blesse vs: and cause his face to shine vpon vs. Selah.
\p
\v 2 That thy way may bee knowen vpon earth, thy sauing health among all nations.
\p
\v 3 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.
\p
\v 4 O let the nations be glad, and sing for ioy: for thou shalt iudge the people righteously; and gouerne the nations vpon earth. Selah.
\p
\v 5 Let the people praise thee, O God, let all the people praise thee.
\p
\v 6 Then shall the earth yeeld her increase; and God, euen our owne God, shall blesse vs.
\p
\v 7 God shall blesse vs; and all the ends of the earth shall feare him.

\c 68
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician. A Psalme or song of Dauid. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him, flee before him.
\p
\v 2 As smoke is driuen away, so driue them away: as waxe melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
\p
\v 3 But let the righteous be glad: let them reioyce before God, yea let them exceedingly reioyce.
\p
\v 4 Sing vnto God, sing praises to his Name: extoll him that rideth vpon the heauens, by his Name Iah, and reioyce before him.
\p
\v 5 A father of the fatherlesse, and a iudge of the widowes, is God in his holy habitation.
\p
\v 6 God setteth the solitary in a families: hee bringeth out those which are bound with chaines, but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.
\p
\v 7 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people; when thou didst march through the wildernes, Selah.
\p
\v 8 The earth shooke, the heauens also dropped at the presence of God: euen Sinai it selfe was mooued at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
\p
\v 9 Thou, O God, didst send a plentifull raine, whereby thou didst confirme thine inheritance, when it was weary.
\p
\v 10 Thy Congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodnesse for the poore.
\p
\v 11 The Lord gaue the word: great was the company of those that published it.
\p
\v 12 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that taried at home, diuided the spoile.
\p
\v 13 Though ye haue lien among the pots, yet shall yee bee as the wings of a doue, couered with siluer, and her feathers with yellow gold.
\p
\v 14 When the Almighty scattered Kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon.
\p
\v 15 The hil of God is as the hill of Bashan, an high hill as the hill of Bashan.
\p
\v 16 Why leape ye, ye high hilles? this is the Hil which God desireth to dwell in, yea the Lord will dwel in it for euer.
\p
\v 17 The chariots of God are twentie thousand, euen thousands of Angels: the Lord is among them as in Sinai, in the holy place.
\p
\v 18 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast ledde captiuitie captiue, thou hast receiued giftes for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among them.
\p
\v 19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth vs with benefits, euen the God of our saluation. Selah.
\p
\v 20 Hee that is our God, is the God of saluation; and vnto God the Lord belong the issues from death.
\p
\v 21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies: and the hairy scalpe of such a one as goeth on still in his trespasses.
\p
\v 22 The Lord said, I will bring againe from Bashan, I will bring my people againe from the depthes of the sea:
\p
\v 23 That thy foote may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogges in the same.
\p
\v 24 They haue seene thy goings, O God, euen the goings of my God, my King, in the Sanctuarie.
\p
\v 25 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; amongst them were the damosels playing with timbrels.
\p
\v 26 Blesse yee God, in the Congregations, euen the Lord, from the fountaine of Israel.
\p
\v 27 There is little Beniamin with their ruler, the princes of Iudah and their Councill, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.
\p
\v 28 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for vs.
\p
\v 29 Because of thy Temple at Ierusalem, shall kings bring presents vnto thee.
\p
\v 30 Rebuke the company of spearemen, the multitude of the bulles, with the calues of the people, till euery one submit himselfe with pieces of siluer: scatter thou the people that delite in warre.
\p
\v 31 Princes shall come out of Egypt, Ethiopia shall soone stretch out her hands vnto God.
\p
\v 32 Sing vnto God, yee kingdomes of the earth: O sing praises vnto the Lord, Selah:
\p
\v 33 To him that rideth vpon the heauens of heauens, which were of olde: loe, hee doeth send out his voice, and that a mightie voice.
\p
\v 34 Ascribe yee strength vnto God: his excellencie is ouer Israel, and his strength is in the cloudes.
\p
\v 35 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giueth strength, and power vnto his people: blessed be God.

\c 69
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician vpon Shoshannim, A Psalme of Dauid. Saue mee, O God, for the waters are come in vnto my soule.
\p
\v 2 I sinke in deepe mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deepe waters, where the flouds ouerflow me.
\p
\v 3 I am weary of my crying, my throate is dried: mine eyes faile while I waite for my God.
\p
\v 4 They that hate mee without a cause, are moe then the haires of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mineenemies wrongfully, are mightie: then I restored that which I tooke not away.
\p
\v 5 O God, thou knowest my foolishnesse; and my sinnes are not hidde from thee.
\p
\v 6 Let not them that waite on thee, O Lord God of hostes, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seeke thee, beconfounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
\p
\v 7 Because for thy sake I haue borne reproch: shame hath couered my face.
\p
\v 8 I am become a stranger vnto my brethren, and an aliant vnto my mothers children.
\p
\v 9 For the zeale of thine house hath eaten mee vp; and the reproches of them that reproched thee, are fallen vpon me.
\p
\v 10 When I wept, and chastened my soule with fasting, that was to my reproch.
\p
\v 11 I made sackecloth also my garment: & I became a prouerbe to them.
\p
\v 12 They that sit in the gate, speake against mee; and I was the song of the drunkards.
\p
\v 13 But as for mee, my prayer is vnto thee, O Lord, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercie heareme, in the trueth of thy saluation.
\p
\v 14 Deliuer me out of the mire, and let me not sinke: let me bee deliuered from them that hate me, and out of thedeepe waters.
\p
\v 15 Let not the water flood ouerflow me, neither let the deepe swallow mee vp, and let not the pit shut her mouth vponme.
\p
\v 16 Heare me, O Lord, for thy louing kindnesse is good: turne vnto mee according to the multitude of thy tendermercies.
\p
\v 17 And hide not thy face from thy seruant, for I am in trouble: heare me speedily.
\p
\v 18 Draw nigh vnto my soule, and redeeme it: deliuer me because of mine enemies.
\p
\v 19 Thou hast knowen my reproch and my shame and my dishonor: mine aduersaries are all before thee.
\p
\v 20 Reproch hath broken my heart, and I am full of heauines: and I looked for some to take pitie, but there was none;and for comforters, but I found none.
\p
\v 21 They gaue mee also gall for my meat, and in my thirst they gaue mee vineger to drinke.
\p
\v 22 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should haue bene for their welfare, let it become atrap.
\p
\v 23 Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; and make their loines continually to shake.
\p
\v 24 Powre out thine indignation vpon them, and let thy wrathfull anger take hold of them.
\p
\v 25 Let their habitation be desolate, and let none dwell in their tents.
\p
\v 26 For they persecute him wh&#333; thou hast smitten, and they talke to the griefe of those whom thou hast wounded.
\p
\v 27 Adde iniquitie vnto their iniquitie: and let them not come into thy righteousnesse.
\p
\v 28 Let them bee blotted out of the booke of the liuing, and not be written with the righteous.
\p
\v 29 But I am poore, and sorowfull: let thy saluation (O God) set me vp on high.
\p
\v 30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnifie him with thankesgiuing.
\p
\v 31 This also shall please the Lord better then an oxe or bullocke that hath hornes and hoofes.
\p
\v 32 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall liue that seeke good.
\p
\v 33 For the Lord heareth the poore, and despiseth not his prisoners.
\p
\v 34 Let the heauen and earth praise him, the seas, and euery thing that moueth therein.
\p
\v 35 For God will saue Sion, and will build the cities of Iudah, that they may dwell there, and haue it in possession.
\p
\v 36 The seede also of his seruants shall inherit it: and they that loue his name shall dwell therein.

\c 70
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician, a psalme of Dauid, to bring to remembrance. Make haste, O God, to deliuer mee, make haste to helpe me, O Lord.
\p
\v 2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seeke after my soule: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
\p
\v 3 Let them be turned backe for a reward of their shame, that say, Aha, aha.
\p
\v 4 Let all those that seeke thee, reioyce, and be glad in thee: and let such as loue thy saluation, say continually, Let God be magnified.
\p
\v 5 But I am poore and needy, make haste vnto me, O God: Thou art my helpe and my deliuerer, O Lord make no tarrying.

\c 71
\p
\v 1 In thee, O Lord, doe I put my trust, let me neuer be put to confusion.
\p
\v 2 Deliuer mee in thy righteousnesse, and cause me to escape: incline thine eare vnto me, and saue me.
\p
\v 3 Bee thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast giuen commandement to saue mee, for thou art my rocke, and my fortresse.
\p
\v 4 Deliuer me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the vnrighteous, and cruel man.
\p
\v 5 For thou art my hope, O Lord God: thou art my trust from my youth.
\p
\v 6 By thee haue I bene holden vp from the wombe: thou art hee that tooke mee out of my mothers vowels, my praise shalbe continually of thee.
\p
\v 7 I am as a wonder vnto many, but thou art my strong refuge.
\p
\v 8 Let my mouth bee filled with thy praise, and with thy honour all the day.
\p
\v 9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.
\p
\v 10 For mine enemies speake against mee: and they that lay waite for my soule, take counsell together,
\p
\v 11 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him, for there is none to deliuer him.
\p
\v 12 O God, be not farre from mee: O my God, make haste for my helpe.
\p
\v 13 Let them be confounded and consumed, that are aduersaries to my soule: let them bee couered with reproch and dishonour, that seeke my hurt.
\p
\v 14 But I wil hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.
\p
\v 15 My mouth shall shew foorth thy righteousnesse, and thy saluation all the day: for I know not the numbers thereof.
\p
\v 16 I will goe in the strength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy righteousnesse, euen of thine onely.
\p
\v 17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto haue I declared thy wonderous workes.
\p
\v 18 Now also when I am old and gray headed, O God, forsake me not: vntill I haue shewed thy strength vnto this generation, and thy power to euery one that is to come.
\p
\v 19 Thy righteousnes also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like vnto thee?
\p
\v 20 Thou which hast shewed mee great, and sore troubles, shalt quicken mee againe, and shalt bring mee vp againe from the depthes of the earth.
\p
\v 21 Thou shalt increase my greatnesse, and comfort me on euery side.
\p
\v 22 I will also praise thee with the psalterie, euen thy trueth, O my God: vnto thee will I sing withthe harpe, O thou Holy one of Israel.
\p
\v 23 My lippes shall greatly reioyce when I sing vnto thee: and my soule, which thou hast redeemed.
\p
\v 24 My tongue also shall talke of thy righteousnesse all the day long: for they are confounded, forthey are brought vnto shame, that seeke my hurt.

\c 72
\p
\v 1 A Psalme for Solomon. Giue the King thy Iudgements, O God, and thy Righteousnesse vnto the Kings sonne.
\p
\v 2 Hee shall iudge thy people with righteousnesse, and thy poore with iudgement.
\p
\v 3 The mountaines shal bring peace to the people, and the litle hils, by righteousnesse.
\p
\v 4 Hee shall iudge the poore of the people, he shall saue the children of the needie, and shallbreake in pieces the oppressour.
\p
\v 5 They shall feare thee as long as the Sunne & Moone indure, throughout all generations.
\p
\v 6 Hee shall come downe like raine vpon the mowen grasse: as showres that water the earth.
\p
\v 7 In his dayes shall the righteous flourish: and abundance of peace so long as the Moone endureth.
\p
\v 8 He shall haue dominion also from sea to sea, and from the riuer, vnto the ends of the earth.
\p
\v 9 They that dwell in the wildernesse shall bowe before him: and his enemies shall licke the dust.
\p
\v 10 The kings of Tarshish and of the Isles shall bring presents: the Kings of Sheba and Seba shalloffer gifts.
\p
\v 11 Yea, all Kings shall fall downe before him: all nations shall serue him.
\p
\v 12 For hee shall deliuer the needy when he crieth: the poore also, and him that hath no helper.
\p
\v 13 He shal spare the poore and needy, and shall saue the soules of the needy.
\p
\v 14 He shall redeeme their soule from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in hissight.
\p
\v 15 And he shall liue, and to him shalbe giuen of the gold of Sheba; prayer also shalbe made for himcontinually, and daily shall he be praised.
\p
\v 16 There shalbe an handfull of corne in the earth vpon the top of the mountaines; the fruit thereofshall shake like Lebanon, and they of the citie shall flourish like grasse of the earth.
\p
\v 17 His name shall endure for euer: his name shalbe continued as long as the sunne: and men shalbeblessed in him; all nations shall call him blessed.
\p
\v 18 Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doth wonderous things.
\p
\v 19 And blessed be his glorious name for euer, and let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen,and Amen.

\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Asaph. Truely God is good to Israel, euen to such as are of a cleane heart.
\p
\v 2 But as for mee, my feete were almost gone: my steps had well-nigh slipt.
\p
\v 3 For I was enuious at the foolish, when I sawe the prosperity of the wicked.
\p
\v 4 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firme.
\p
\v 5 They are not in trouble as other men: neither are they plagued like other men.
\p
\v 6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chaine: violence couereth them as a garment.
\p
\v 7 Their eies stand out with fatnes: they haue more then heart could wish.
\p
\v 8 They are corrupt, and speake wickedly concerning oppression: they speake loftily.
\p
\v 9 They set their mouth against the heauens; and their tongue walketh through the earth.
\p
\v 10 Therefore his people returne hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.
\p
\v 11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?
\p
\v 12 Behold, these are the vngodly: who prosper in the world, they increase in riches.
\p
\v 13 Uerily I haue cleansed my heart in vaine, and washed my hands in innocencie.
\p
\v 14 For all the day long haue I bene plagued, and chastened euery morning.
\p
\v 15 If I say, I will speake thus: behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.
\p
\v 16 When I thought to know this, it was too painfull for me,
\p
\v 17 Untill I went into the Sanctuarie of God; then vnderstood I their end.
\p
\v 18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them downe into destruction.
\p
\v 19 How are they brought into desolation as in a moment? they are vtterly consumed with terrours.
\p
\v 20 As a dreame when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest thou shalt despise their image.
\p
\v 21 Thus my heart was greeued, and I was pricked in my reines.
\p
\v 22 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.
\p
\v 23 Neuerthelesse I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.
\p
\v 24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsell; and afterward receiue me to glory.
\p
\v 25 Whom haue I in heauen but thee? and there is none vpon earth that I desire besides thee.
\p
\v 26 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for euer.
\p
\v 27 For loe, they that are farre from thee, shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that goe awhoring from thee.
\p
\v 28 But it is good for me, to drawe neere to God: I haue put my trust in the Lord God, that I maydeclare all thy workes.

\c 74
\p
\v 1 Maschil of Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast vs off for euer? why doeth thine anger smoke against the sheepe of thy pasture?
\p
\v 2 Remember thy Congregation which thou hast purchased of olde: the rod of thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed, this mount Sion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
\p
\v 3 Lift vp thy feete vnto the perpetuall desolations: euen all that the enemie hath done wickedly in the Sanctuarie.
\p
\v 4 Thine enemies roare in the midst of thy congregations: they set vp their ensignes for signes.
\p
\v 5 A man was famous according as he had lifted vp axes vpon the thicke trees.
\p
\v 6 But now they breake downe the carued worke thereof at once, with axes and hammers.
\p
\v 7 They haue cast fire into thy Sanctuary, they haue defiled by casting downe, the dwelling place of thy Nawe to the ground.
\p
\v 8 They said in their hearts, Let vs destroy them together: they haue burnt vp all the Synagogues of God in the land.
\p
\v 9 We see not our signes, there is no more any prophet, neither is there among vs any that knoweth howe long.
\p
\v 10 O God, how long shall the aduersarie reproach? shall the enemie blaspheme thy Name for euer?
\p
\v 11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, euen thy right hand? plucke it out of thy bosome.
\p
\v 12 For God is my King of old working saluation in the midst of the earth.
\p
\v 13 Thou didst diuide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.
\p
\v 14 Thou brakest the heads of Leuiathan in pieces, and gauest him to bee meat to the people inhabiting the wildernesse.
\p
\v 15 Thou didst cleaue the fountaine and the flood: thou driedst vp mightie riuers.
\p
\v 16 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sunne.
\p
\v 17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: Thou hast made Summer and Winter.
\p
\v 18 Remember this, that the enemie hath reproached, O Lord, and that the foolish people haue blasphemed thy Name.
\p
\v 19 O deliuer not the soule of thy turtle doue vnto the multitude of the wicked forget not the Congregation of thy poore for euer.
\p
\v 20 Haue respect vnto the couenant: for the darke places of the earth are full of the habitations of crueltie.
\p
\v 21 O let not the oppressed returne ashamed: let the poore and needie praise thy name.
\p
\v 22 Arise, O God, plead thine owne cause: remember how the foolish man reprocheth thee daily.
\p
\v 23 Forget not the voyce of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise vp against thee, increaseth continually.

\c 75
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician Al-taschith, A Psalme or song of Asaph. Unto thee, O God, doe we giue thankes, vnto thee doe we giue thanks: for that thy name is nere, thy wonderous works declare.
\p
\v 2 When I shall receiue the congregation, I will iudge vprightly.
\p
\v 3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolued: I beare vp the pillars of it. Selah.
\p
\v 4 I said vnto the fooles, Deale not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not vp the horne.
\p
\v 5 Lift not vp your horne on high: speake not with a stiffe necke.
\p
\v 6 For promotion commeth neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South.
\p
\v 7 But God is the iudge: he putteth downe one, and setteth vp another.
\p
\v 8 For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full of mixture, and he powreth out of the same: but the dregges thereof all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drinke them.
\p
\v 9 But I will declare for euer; I will sing praises to the God of Iacob.
\p
\v 10 All the hornes of the wicked also will I cut off; but the hornes of the righteous shall be exalted.

\c 76
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician on Neginoth, a Psalme or song of Asaph. In Iudah is God knowen: his name is great in Israel.
\p
\v 2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Sion.
\p
\v 3 There brake he the arrowes of the bowe, the shield, and the sword, and the battell. Selah.
\p
\v 4 Thou art more glorious and excellent then the mountaines of pray.
\p
\v 5 The stout hearted are spoiled, they haue slept their sleepe: and none of the men of might haue found their hands.
\p
\v 6 At thy rebuke, O God of Iacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleepe.
\p
\v 7 Thou, euen thou art to be feared; and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
\p
\v 8 Thou didst cause iudgement to be heard from heauen: the earth feared and was still,
\p
\v 9 When God arose to iudgement, to saue all the meeke of the earth. Selah.
\p
\v 10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restraine.
\p
\v 11 Uowe, and pay vnto the Lord your God; let all that be round about him bring presents vnto him that ought to be feared.
\p
\v 12 Hee shall cut off the spirit of princes: hee is terrible to the kings of the earth.

\c 77
\p
\v 1 I cryed vnto God with my voice: euen vnto God with my voice, and he gaue eare vnto me.
\p
\v 2 In the day of my trouble, I sought the Lord; my sore ranne in the night, and ceased not: my soule refused to be comforted.
\p
\v 3 I remembred God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was ouerwhelmed. Selah.
\p
\v 4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speake.
\p
\v 5 I haue considered the dayes of old, the yeeres of auncient times.
\p
\v 6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine owne heart, and my spirit made diligent search.
\p
\v 7 Will the Lord cast off for euer? and will hee be fauourable no more?
\p
\v 8 Is his mercy cleane gone for euer? doth his promise faile for euermore?
\p
\v 9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut vp his tender mercies? Selah.
\p
\v 10 And I sayd, This is my infirmitie: but I will remember the yeeres of the right hand of the most high.
\p
\v 11 I will remember the workes of the Lord: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
\p
\v 12 I will meditate also of all thy worke, and talke of thy doings.
\p
\v 13 Thy way, O God, is in the Sanctuarie: who is so great a God, as our God?
\p
\v 14 Thou art the God that doest wonders; thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
\p
\v 15 Thou hast with thine arme redeemed thy people, the sonnes of Iacob and Ioseph. Selah.
\p
\v 16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: they were afraid; the depths also were troubled.
\p
\v 17 The cloudes powred out water, the skies sent out a sound; thine arrowes also went abroad.
\p
\v 18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heauen: the lightnings lightned the world, the earth trembled and shooke.
\p
\v 19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters: and thy foot-steps are not knowen.
\p
\v 20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

\c 78
\p
\v 1 Giue eare, O my people, to my Lawe: incline your eares to the wordes of my mouth.
\p
\v 2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I wil vtter darke sayings of old:
\p
\v 3 Which we haue heard, & knowen: and our fathers haue told vs.
\p
\v 4 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come, the praises of the Lord: and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
\p
\v 5 For he established a Testimony in Iacob, and appointed a Law in Israel, which he commaunded our fathers: that they should make them knowen to their children.
\p
\v 6 That the generation to come might know them, euen the children which should be borne: who should arise and declare them to their children:
\p
\v 7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God: but keepe his Commandements,
\p
\v 8 And might not bee as their fathers, a stubborne and rebellious generation, a generation that set not their heart aright: and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
\p
\v 9 The children of Ephraim being armed, and carying bowes, turned backe in the day of battell.
\p
\v 10 They kept not the couenant of God: and refused to walke in his Law:
\p
\v 11 And forgat his workes: and his wonders that he had shewed them.
\p
\v 12 Marueilous things did he in the sight of their fathers: in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
\p
\v 13 Hee diuided the Sea, and caused them to passe through: and he made the waters to stand as an heape.
\p
\v 14 In the day time also he led them with a cloud: and all the night with a light of fire.
\p
\v 15 Hee claue the rockes in the wildernes: and gaue them drinke as out of the great depthes.
\p
\v 16 Hee brought streames also out of the rocke, and caused waters to runne downe like riuers.
\p
\v 17 And they sinned yet more against him: by prouoking the most High in the wildernes.
\p
\v 18 And they tempted God in their heart: by asking meat for their lust.
\p
\v 19 Yea, they spake against God: they said, Can God furnish a table in the wildernes?
\p
\v 20 Behold, he smote the rocke, that the waters gushed out, & the streames ouerflowed; can he giue bread also? can he prouide flesh for his people?
\p
\v 21 Therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth, so a fire was kindled against Iacob: and anger also came vp against Israel.
\p
\v 22 Because they beleeued not in God: and trusted not in his saluation:
\p
\v 23 Though he had commanded the cloudes from aboue: and opened the doores of heauen:
\p
\v 24 And had rained downe Manna vpon them to eate, and had giuen them of the corne of heauen.
\p
\v 25 Man did eate Angels food: hee sent them meat to the full.
\p
\v 26 He caused an East wind to blow in the heauen: and by his power hee brought in the South wind.
\p
\v 27 He rained flesh also vpon them as dust: and feathered soules like as the sand of the sea.
\p
\v 28 And hee let it fall in the midst of their campe, round about their habitations.
\p
\v 29 So they did eate, & were well filled: for he gaue them their owne desire.
\p
\v 30 They were not estranged from their lust: but while their meate was yet in their mouthes,
\p
\v 31 The wrath of God came vpon them, and slew the fattest of them: and smote downe the chosen men of Israel.
\p
\v 32 For all this they sinned still: and beleeued not for his wondrous works.
\p
\v 33 Therefore their dayes did he consume in vanitie, and their yeeres in trouble.
\p
\v 34 When hee slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and inquired early after God.
\p
\v 35 And they remembred that God was their rocke: and the high God, their redeemer.
\p
\v 36 Neuerthelesse they did flatter him with their mouth: and they lyed vnto him with their tongues.
\p
\v 37 For their heart was not right with him: neither were they stedfast in his couenant.
\p
\v 38 But hee being full of compassion, forgaue their iniquity, and destroyed them not; yea many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stirre vp all his wrath.
\p
\v 39 For he remembred that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and commeth not againe.
\p
\v 40 How oft did they prouoke him in the wildernesse: and grieue him in the desert?
\p
\v 41 Yea they turned backe and tempted God: and limited the holy one of Israel.
\p
\v 42 They remembred not his hand: nor the day when hee deliuered them from the enemie:
\p
\v 43 How he had wrought his signes in Egypt: and his wonders in the field of Zoan:
\p
\v 44 And had turned their riuers into blood: and their flouds, that they could not drinke.
\p
\v 45 Hee sent diuers sorts of flies among them, which deuoured them: and frogges which destroyed them.
\p
\v 46 He gaue also their increase vnto the caterpiller: and their labour vnto the locust.
\p
\v 47 He destroyed their vines with haile: and their Sycomore trees with frost.
\p
\v 48 He gaue vp their cattel also to the haile: and their flockes to hot thunder-bolts.
\p
\v 49 He cast vpon them the fiercenesse of his anger, wrath and indignation, and trouble: by sending euill angels among them.
\p
\v 50 He made a way to his anger, hee spared not their soule from death: but gaue their life ouer to the pestilence.
\p
\v 51 And smote all the first borne in Egypt: the chiefe of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
\p
\v 52 But made his owne people to goe forth like sheepe: and guided them in the wildernesse like a flocke.
\p
\v 53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea ouerwhelmed their enemies.
\p
\v 54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuarie: euen to this mountaine which his right hand had purchased.
\p
\v 55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and diuided them an inheritance by line: and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
\p
\v 56 Yet they tempted and prouoked the most high God: and kept not his testimonies:
\p
\v 57 But turned backe, and dealt vnfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitfull bowe.
\p
\v 58 For they prouoked him to anger with their high places: and moued him to ielousie with their grauen images.
\p
\v 59 When God heard this, hee was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
\p
\v 60 So that he forsooke the tabernacle of Shiloh: the tent which he placed among men,
\p
\v 61 And deliuered his strength into captiuitie: and his glory into the enemies hand.
\p
\v 62 He gaue his people ouer also vnto the sword: and was wroth with his inheritance.
\p
\v 63 The fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not giuen to mariage.
\p
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword: and their widowes made no lamentation.
\p
\v 65 Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleepe: and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
\p
\v 66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetuall reproch.
\p
\v 67 Moreouer he refused the tabernacle of Ioseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim.
\p
\v 68 But chose the tribe of Iudah: the mount Sion which he loued.
\p
\v 69 And he built his sanctuarie like high palaces: like the earth which he hath established for euer.
\p
\v 70 He chose Dauid also his seruant, and tooke him from the sheepe-folds:
\p
\v 71 From following the ewes great with young, hee brought him to feed Iacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
\p
\v 72 So he fed them according to the integritie of his heart: and guided them by the skilfulnesse of his hands.

\p
\v 1 A psalme of Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into thine, inheritance, thy holy temple haue they defiled: they haue layd Ierusalem on heapes.
\p
\v 2 The dead bodies of thy seruants haue they giuen to bee meate vnto the foules of the heauen: the flesh of thy Saints vnto the beasts of the earth.
\p
\v 3 Their blood haue they shed like water round about Ierusalem: and there was none to burie them.
\p
\v 4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours: a scorne and derision to them that are round about vs.
\p
\v 5 How long, Lord, wilt thou be angry, for euer? shall thy ielousie burne like fire?
\p
\v 6 Powre out thy wrath vpon the heathen that haue not knowen thee, and vpon the kingdomes that haue not called vpon thy name.
\p
\v 7 For they haue deuoured Iacob: and laid waste his dwelling place.
\p
\v 8 O remember not against vs former iniquities, let thy tender mercies speedily preuent vs: for we are brought very low.
\p
\v 9 Helpe vs, O God of our saluation, for the glory of thy Name: and deliuer vs, and purge away our sinnes for thy Names sake.
\p
\v 10 Wherfore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be knowen among the heathen in our sight by the reuenging of the blood of thy seruants which is shed.
\p
\v 11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee, according to the greatnesse of thy power: preserue thou those that are appointed to die.
\p
\v 12 And render vnto our neighbours seuen fold into their bosome, their reproach wherewith they haue reproched thee, O Lord.
\p
\v 13 So we thy people and sheepe of thy pasture, will giue thee thankes for euer: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.

\p
\v 2 Before Ephraim and Beniamin, and Manasseh, stirre vp thy strength: and come and saue vs.
\p
\v 3 Turne vs againe, O God: and cause thy face to shine, and we shall bee saued.
\p
\v 4 O Lord God of hosts, how long wilt thou bee angry against the prayer of thy people?
\p
\v 5 Thou feedest them with the bread of teares: and giuest them teares to drinke in great measure.
\p
\v 6 Thou makest vs a strife vnto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselues.
\p
\v 7 Turne vs againe, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saued.
\p
\v 8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
\p
\v 9 Thou preparedst roome before it: and didst cause it to take deepe root, and it filled the land.
\p
\v 10 The hilles were couered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.
\p
\v 11 She sent out her boughs vnto the Sea: and her branches vnto the riuer.
\p
\v 12 Why hast thou then broken downe her hedges: so that all they which passe by the way, doe plucke her?
\p
\v 13 The boare out of the wood doth waste it: and the wild beast of the field doth deuoure it.
\p
\v 14 Returne, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: looke downe from heauen, and behold, and visit this vine:
\p
\v 15 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted: and the branch that thou madest strong for thy selfe.
\p
\v 16 It is burnt with fire, it is cut downe: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
\p
\v 17 Let thy hand be vpon the man of thy right hand: vpon the sonne of man, whom thou madest strong for thy selfe.
\p
\v 18 So will not wee goe backe from thee: quicken vs, and we will call vpon thy Name.

\v 1 To the chiefe Musician vpon Gittith. A Psalme of Asaph. Sing alowd vnto God our strength: make a ioyfull noise vnto the God of Iacob.
\p
\v 2 Take a Psalme, and bring hither the timbrell: the pleasant harpe with the psalterie.
\p
\v 3 Blow vp the trumpet in the new Moone: in the time appointed on our solemne feast day.
\p
\v 4 For this was a Statute for Israel: and a Law of the God of Iacob.
\p
\v 5 This he ordained in Ioseph for a testimonie, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language, that I vnderstood not.
\p
\v 6 I remoued his shoulder from the burden: his handes were deliuered from the pots.
\p
\v 7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I deliuered thee, I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proued thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
\p
\v 8 Heare, O my people, and I will testifie vnto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken vnto me:
\p
\v 9 There shall no strange God be in thee: neither shalt thou worship any strange God.
\p
\v 10 I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
\p
\v 11 But my people would not hearken to my voice: and Israel would none of me.
\p
\v 12 So I gaue them vp vnto their owne hearts lust: and they walked in in their owne counsels.
\p
\v 13 O that my people had hearkned vnto me: and Israel had walked in my wayes!
\p
\v 14 I should soone haue subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their aduersaries.
\p
\v 15 The haters of the Lord should haue submitted themselues vnto him: but their time should haue endured for euer.
\p
\v 16 Hee should haue fedde them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honie out of the rocke, should I haue satisfied thee.

\c 82
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Asaph. God standeth in the Congregation of the mightie: hee iudgeth among the gods.
\p
\v 2 How long will yee iudge vniustly: and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
\p
\v 3 Defend the poore and fatherlesse: doe iustice to the afflicted and needie.
\p
\v 4 Deliuer the poore and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
\p
\v 5 They know not, neither wil they vnderstand; they walke on in darknes: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
\p
\v 6 I haue said, Ye are gods: and all of you are children of the most High:
\p
\v 7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the Princes.
\p
\v 8 Arise, O God, iudge the earth: for thou shalt inherite all nations.

\c 83
\p
\v 1 A song or Psalme of Asaph. Keepe not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
\p
\v 2 For loe, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee, haue lift vp the head.
\p
\v 3 They haue taken craftie counsell against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
\p
\v 4 They haue said, Come, and let vs cut them off from being a nation: that the name of Israel may bee no more in remembrance.
\p
\v 5 For they haue consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee.
\p
\v 6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites: of Moab, and the Hagarens.
\p
\v 7 Gebal and Ammon, and Amalek: the Philistines, with the inhabitants of Tyre.
\p
\v 8 Assur also is ioyned with them: they haue holpen the children of Lot. Selah.
\p
\v 9 Doe vnto them as vnto the Midianites: as to Sisera, as to Iabin, at the brooke of Kison:
\p
\v 10 Which perished at En-dor: they became as dung for the earth.
\p
\v 11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
\p
\v 12 Who sayd, Let vs take to our selues, the houses of God in possession.
\p
\v 13 O my God, make them like a wheele: as the stubble before the wind.
\p
\v 14 As the fire burneth a wood: and as the flame setteth the mountaines on fire:
\p
\v 15 So persecute them with thy tempest: and make them afraid with thy storme.
\p
\v 16 Fill their faces with shame: that they may seeke thy name, O Lord.
\p
\v 17 Let them be confounded and troubled for euer: yea let them be put to shame, and perish:
\p
\v 18 That men may knowe, that thou, whose name alone is IEHOVAH: art the most High ouer all the earth.

\c 84
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician vpon Gittith, a Psalme for the sonnes of Korah. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hostes!
\p
\v 2 My soule longeth, yea euen fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh cryeth out for the liuing God.
\p
\v 3 Yea the sparrowe hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for her selfe, where she may lay her young, euen thine altars, O Lord of hostes, my king and my God.
\p
\v 4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they wilbe still praysing thee. Selah.
\p
\v 5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee: in whose heart are the wayes of them:
\p
\v 6 Who passing through the valley of Baca, make it a well: the raine also filleth the pooles.
\p
\v 7 They goe from strength to strength: euery one of them in Zion appeareth before God.
\p
\v 8 O Lord God of hostes, heare my prayer: giue eare, O God of Iacob. Selah.
\p
\v 9 Behold, O God our shield: and looke vpon the face of thine anointed.
\p
\v 10 For a day in thy courts, is better then a thousand: I had rather be a doore keeper in the house of my God, then to dwell in the tents of wickednesse.
\p
\v 11 For the Lord God is a sunne and shield: the Lord will giue grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walke vprightly.
\p
\v 12 O Lord of hostes: blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.

\c 85
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe musician, a Psalme for the sonnes of Korah. Lord, thou hast bene fauourable vnto thy land: thou hast brought backe the captiuity of Iacob.
\p
\v 2 Thou hast forgiuen the iniquitie of thy people, thou hast couered all their sinne. Selah.
\p
\v 3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thy selfe from the fiercenesse of thine anger.
\p
\v 4 Turne vs, O God of our saluation: and cause thine anger towards vs to cease.
\p
\v 5 Wilt thou be angry with vs for euer? wilt thou drawe out thine anger to all generations?
\p
\v 6 Wilt thou not reuiue vs againe: that thy people may reioyce in thee?
\p
\v 7 Shew vs thy mercy, O Lord; and graunt vs thy saluation.
\p
\v 8 I will heare what God the Lord will speake: for hee will speake peace vnto his people, and to his Saints: but let them not turne againe to folly.
\p
\v 9 Surely his saluation is nigh them that feare him; that glory may dwell in our land.
\p
\v 10 Mercy and truth are met together: righteousnesse and peace haue kissed each other.
\p
\v 11 Truth shall spring out of the earth: and righteousnesse shall looke downe from heauen.
\p
\v 12 Yea the Lord shall giue that which is good: and our land shall yeeld her increase.
\p
\v 13 Righteousnes shall go before him: and shall set vs in the way of his steps.

\c 86
\p
\v 1 A prayer of Dauid. Bow downe thine eare, O Lord, heare me: for I am poore & needy.
\p
\v 2 Preserue my soule, for I am holy: O thou my God, saue thy seruant, that trusteth in thee.
\p
\v 3 Be merciful vnto me, O Lord: for I cry vnto thee daily.
\p
\v 4 Reioyce the soule of thy seruant: for vnto thee (O Lord) doe I lift vp my soule.
\p
\v 5 For thou Lord art good, and ready to forgiue: and plenteous in mercie vnto all them that call vpon thee.
\p
\v 6 Giue eare O Lord, vnto my prayer: and attend to the voice of my supplications.
\p
\v 7 In the day of my trouble I will call vpon thee: for thou wilt answere mee.
\p
\v 8 Among the gods there is none like vnto thee (O Lord:) neither are there any workes like vnto thy workes.
\p
\v 9 All nations whom thou hast made, shall come and worship before thee, O Lord: and shall glorifie thy Name.
\p
\v 10 For thou art great, and doest wonderous things: thou art God alone.
\p
\v 11 Teach me thy way, O Lord, I will walke in thy trueth: vnite my heart to feare thy Name.
\p
\v 12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I wil glorifie thy Name for euermore.
\p
\v 13 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast deliuered my soule from the lowest hell.
\p
\v 14 O God, the proud are risen against mee, and the assemblies of violent men haue sought after my soule: and haue not set thee before them.
\p
\v 15 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious: long suffering, and plenteous in mercy and trueth.
\p
\v 16 O turne vnto me, and haue mercie vpon me, giue thy strength vnto thy seruant: and saue the sonne of thine handmaid.
\p
\v 17 Shew me a token for good, that they which hate me may see it, and bee ashamed: because thou, Lord, hast holpen me, and comforted me.

\v 1 A Psalme or song for the sonnes of Korah. His foundation is in the holy mountaines.
\p
\v 2 The Lord loueth the gates of Zion: more then all the dwellings of Iacob.
\p
\v 3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O Citie of God. Selah.
\p
\v 4 I will make mention of Rahab, and Babylon, to them that know mee; behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia: this man was borne there.
\p
\v 5 And of Zion it shalbe said, This and that man was borne in her: and the highest himselfe shall establish her.
\p
\v 6 The Lord shall count when he writeth vp the people: that this man was borne there. Selah.
\p
\v 7 As wel the singers as the players on instruments shall bee there: all my springs are in thee.

\p
\v 1 A song or Psalme for the sonnes of Korah, to the chiefe Musician vpon Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite. O Lord God of my saluation, I haue cried day and night before thee.
\p
\v 2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine eare vnto my cry.
\p
\v 3 For my soule is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh vnto the graue.
\p
\v 4 I am counted with them that go downe into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength.
\p
\v 5 Free among the dead, like the slaine that lie in the graue, whom thou remembrest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
\p
\v 6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit: in darkenesse, in the deepes.
\p
\v 7 Thy wrath lieth hard vpon me: and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waues. Selah.
\p
\v 8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance farre from mee: thou hast made me an abomination vnto them: I am shut vp, and I cannot come forth.
\p
\v 9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction, Lord, I haue called daily vpon thee: I haue stretched out my hands vnto thee.
\p
\v 10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shal the dead arise and praise thee? Selah.
\p
\v 11 Shall thy louing kindnesse be declared in the graue? or thy faithfulnesse in destruction?
\p
\v 12 Shall thy wonders be knowen in the darke? and thy righteousnesse in the land of forgetfulnesse?
\p
\v 13 But vnto thee haue I cried, O Lord, and in the morning shall my prayer preuent thee.
\p
\v 14 Lord, why castest thou off my soule? why hidest thou thy face from me?
\p
\v 15 I am afflicted and ready to die, from my youth vp: while I suffer thy terrours, I am distracted.
\p
\v 16 Thy fierce wrath goeth ouer me: thy terrours haue cut me off.
\p
\v 17 They came round about mee daily like water: they compassed mee about together.
\p
\v 18 Louer and friend hast thou put farre from me: and mine acquaintance into darkenesse.

\c 89
\p
\v 1 Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite. I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for euer: with my mouth will I make knowen thy faithfulnesse to all generations.
\p
\v 2 For I haue said, Mercie shall bee built vp for euer: thy faithfulnesse shalt thou establish in the very heauens.
\p
\v 3 I haue made a couenant with my chosen: I haue sworne vnto Dauid my seruant.
\p
\v 4 Thy seed will I stablish for euer: and build vp thy throne to all generations. Selah.
\p
\v 5 And the heauens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord: thy faithfulnes also in the congregation of the Saints.
\p
\v 6 For who in the heauen can be compared vnto the Lord? who among the sonnes of the mightie can be likened vnto the Lord?
\p
\v 7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the Saints: and to bee had in reuerence of all them that are about him.
\p
\v 8 O Lord God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like vnto thee? or to thy faithfulnesse round about thee?
\p
\v 9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waues thereof arise; thou stillest them.
\p
\v 10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slaine: thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arme.
\p
\v 11 The heauens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulnes thereof, thou hast founded them.
\p
\v 12 The North and the South, thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall reioyce in thy Name.
\p
\v 13 Thou hast a mighty arme: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
\p
\v 14 Iustice and iudgement are the habitation of thy throne: mercie and trueth shall goe before thy face.
\p
\v 15 Blessed is the people that knowe the ioyfull sound: they shall walke O Lord in the light of thy countenance.
\p
\v 16 In thy name shall they reioyce all the day: and in thy righteousnes shall they be exalted.
\p
\v 17 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy fauour our horne shall be exalted.
\p
\v 18 For the Lord is our defence: and the holy One of Israel is our king.
\p
\v 19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I haue laid helpe vpon one that is mightie: I haue exalted one chosen out of the people.
\p
\v 20 I haue found Dauid my seruant: with my holy oile haue I anointed him.
\p
\v 21 With whome my hand shall bee established: mine arme also shall strengthen him.
\p
\v 22 The enemie shall not exact vpon him: nor the sonne of wickednesse afflict him.
\p
\v 23 And I will beate downe his foes before his face: and plague them that hate him.
\p
\v 24 But my faithfulnesse and my mercy shalbe with him: and in my name shall his horne be exalted.
\p
\v 25 I will set his hand also in the sea: and his right hand in the riuers.
\p
\v 26 He shall crie vnto mee, Thou art my father: my God, and the rocke of my saluation.
\p
\v 27 Also I will make him my first borne: higher then the kings of the earth.
\p
\v 28 My mercy will I keepe for him for euermore: and my couenant shall stand fast with him.
\p
\v 29 His seed also will I make to indure for euer: and his throne as the dayes of heauen.
\p
\v 30 If his children forsake my lawe, and walke not in my iudgements;
\p
\v 31 If they breake my statutes, and keepe not my commandements:
\p
\v 32 Then will I visite their transgression with the rod, and their iniquitie with stripes.
\p
\v 33 Neuerthelesse, my louing kindnesse will I not vtterly take from him: nor suffer my faithfulnesse to faile.
\p
\v 34 My couenant will I not breake: nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lippes.
\p
\v 35 Once haue I sworne by my holinesse; that I will not lye vnto Dauid.
\p
\v 36 His seede shall endure for euer; and his throne as the sunne before me.
\p
\v 37 It shalbe established for euer as the Moone: and as a faithfull witnesse in heauen. Selah.
\p
\v 38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred: thou hast bene wroth with thine anointed.
\p
\v 39 Thou hast made voyd the couenant of thy seruant: thou hast profaned his crowne, by casting it to the ground.
\p
\v 40 Thou hast broken downe all his hedges: thou hast brought his strong holds to ruine.
\p
\v 41 All that passe by the way; spoile him: hee is a reproach to his neighbours.
\p
\v 42 Thou hast set vp the right hand of his aduersaries: thou hast made all his enemies to reioyce.
\p
\v 43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword: and hast not made him to stand in the battaile.
\p
\v 44 Thou hast made his glory to cease: and cast his throne downe to the ground.
\p
\v 45 The dayes of his youth hast thou shortned: thou hast couered him with shame. Selah.
\p
\v 46 How long, Lord, wilt thou hide thy selfe, for euer? shall thy wrath burne like fire?
\p
\v 47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vaine?
\p
\v 48 What man is he that liueth, and shall not see death? shall he deliuer his soule from the hand of the graue? Selah.
\p
\v 49 Lord, where are thy former louing kindnesses, which thou swarest vnto Dauid in thy trueth?
\p
\v 50 Remember (Lord) the reproach of thy seruants: how I doe beare in my bosome the reproache of all the mighty people.
\p
\v 51 Wherewith thine enemies haue reproached, O Lord: wherewith they haue reproached the foote-steppes of thine Annointed.
\p
\v 52 Blessed be the Lord for euermore, Amen, and Amen.

\p
\v 1 A prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast bene our dwelling place in all generations.
\p
\v 2 Before the mountaines were broughtforth, or euer thou hadst formed the earth and the world: euen from euerlasting to euerlasting thou art God.
\p
\v 3 Thou turnest man to destruction: and sayest, Returne yee children of men.
\p
\v 4 For a thousand yeeres in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past: and as a watch in the night.
\p
\v 5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood, they are as a sleepe: in the morning they are like grasse which groweth vp.
\p
\v 6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth vp: in the euening it is cut downe, and withereth.
\p
\v 7 For we are consumed by thine anger: and by thy wrath are we troubled.
\p
\v 8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee: our secret sinnes in the light of thy countenance.
\p
\v 9 For all our dayes are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our yeeres as a tale that is told.
\p
\v 10 The dayes of our yeres are threescore yeeres and ten, and if by reason of strength they be fourescore yeeres, yet is their strength labour and sorrow: for it is soone cut off, and we flie away.
\p
\v 11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? euen according to thy feare, so is thy wrath.
\p
\v 12 So teach vs to number our daies: that wee may apply our hearts vnto wisedome.
\p
\v 13 Returne (O Lord) how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy seruants.
\p
\v 14 O satisfie vs early with thy mercie: that we may reioyce, and be glad all our dayes.
\p
\v 15 Make vs glad according to the dayes wherein thou hast afflicted vs: and the yeeres wherein we haue seene euil.
\p
\v 16 Let thy worke appeare vnto thy seruants: and thy glory vnto their children.
\p
\v 17 And let the beautie of the Lord our God be vpon vs, and establish thou the worke of our hands vpon vs: yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.

\c 91
\p
\v 1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high: shall abide vnder the shadow of the Almightie.
\p
\v 2 I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge, and my fortresse: my God, in him will I trust.
\p
\v 3 Surely he shall deliuer thee from the snare of the fouler: and from the noisome pestilence.
\p
\v 4 Hee shall couer thee with his feathers, and vnder his wings shalt thou trust: his trueth shall bee thy shield and buckler.
\p
\v 5 Thou shalt not bee afraid for the terrour by night: nor for the arrow that flieth by day:
\p
\v 6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darknes: nor for the destruction, that wasteth at noone-day.
\p
\v 7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall not come nigh thee.
\p
\v 8 Onely with thine eyes shalt thou behold: & see the reward of the wicked.
\p
\v 9 Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, euen the most High, thy habitation:
\p
\v 10 There shall no euill befall thee: neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
\p
\v 11 For hee shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee: to keepe thee in all thy wayes.
\p
\v 12 They shall beare thee vp in their hands: lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
\p
\v 13 Thou shalt tread vpon the Lion, and adder: the yong Lion and the dragon shalt thou trample vnder feete.
\p
\v 14 Because he hath set his loue vpon me, therefore will I deliuer him: I wil set him on high, because hee hath knowen my Name.
\p
\v 15 He shall call vpon me, and I will answere him: I will bee with him in trouble, I will deliuer him, and honour him.
\p
\v 16 With long life wil I satisfie him: and shew him my saluation.

\c 92
\p
\v 1 A Psalme or song for the Sabbath day. It is a good thing to giue thanks vnto the Lord, and to sing praises vnto thy Name, O most High:
\p
\v 2 To shew foorth thy louing kindnesse in the morning: and thy faithfulnesse euery night:
\p
\v 3 Upon an instrument of tenne strings, and vpon the psalterie: vpon the harpe with a solemne sound.
\p
\v 4 For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy worke: I will triumph in the workes of thy hands.
\p
\v 5 O Lord, how great are thy workes! and thy thoughts are very deepe.
\p
\v 6 A brutish man knoweth not: neither doeth a foole vnderstand this.
\p
\v 7 When the wicked spring as the grasse, and when all the workers of iniquitie doe flourish: it is that they shall be destroyed for euer.
\p
\v 8 ยถ But thou, Lord, art most high for euermore.
\p
\v 9 For loe, thine enemies, O Lord, for loe, thine enemies shall perish: all the workers of iniquity shalbe scattred.
\p
\v 10 But my horne shalt thou exalt like the horne of an vnicorne: I shalbe anointed with fresh oyle.
\p
\v 11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies: and mine eares shall heare my desire of the wicked that rise vp against me.
\p
\v 12 The righteous shal flourish like the palme tree: hee shall growe like a cedar in Lebanon.
\p
\v 13 Those that be planted in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the courts of our God.
\p
\v 14 They shal still bring forth fruit in old age: they shalbe fat, & flourishing:

\v 15 To shew that the Lord is vpright: hee is my rocke, and there is no vnrighteousnesse in him.

\c 93
\p
\v 1 The Lord reigneth, he is clothed with Maiestie, the Lord is clothed with strength, wherewith hee hath girded himselfe: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moued.
\p
\v 2 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from euerlasting.
\p
\v 3 The floods haue lifted vp, O Lord, the floods haue lifted vp their voice: the floods lift vp their waues.
\p
\v 4 The Lord on high is mightier then the noise of many waters, yea then the mightie waues of the Sea.
\p
\v 5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holinesse becommeth thine house, O Lord, for euer.

\p
\v 1 O Lord God, to whome vengeance belongeth: O God to whome vengeance belongeth, shew thy selfe.

\v 2 Lift vp thy selfe, thou iudge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.
\p
\v 3 Lord, how long shall the wicked? how long shall the wicked triumph?
\p
\v 4 How long shal they vtter, and speake hard things? and all the workers of iniquitie boast themselues?
\p
\v 5 They breake in pieces thy people, O Lord: and afflict thine heritage.
\p
\v 6 They slay the widowe and the stranger: and murder the fatherlesse.
\p
\v 7 Yet they say, The Lord shall not see: neither shall the God of Iacob regard it.
\p
\v 8 Understand, yee brutish among the people: and ye fooles, when will ye be wise?
\p
\v 9 He that planted the eare, shall he not heare? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?
\p
\v 10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? hee that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?
\p
\v 11 The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man: that they are vanitie.
\p
\v 12 Blessed is the man whome thou chastenest, O Lord: and teachest him out of thy Law:
\p
\v 13 That thou mayest giue him rest from the dayes of aduersitie: vntill the pit be digged for the wicked.
\p
\v 14 For the Lord will not cast off his people: neither will he forsake his inheritance.
\p
\v 15 But iudgement shall returne vnto righteousnesse: and all the vpright in heart shall follow it.
\p
\v 16 Who will rise vp for mee against the euill doers? or who will stand vp for me against the workers of iniquitie?
\p
\v 17 Unlesse the Lord had bene my helpe: my soule had almost dwelt in silence.
\p
\v 18 When I said, My foote slippeth: thy mercie, O Lord, held me vp.
\p
\v 19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my soule.
\p
\v 20 Shal the throne of iniquitie haue fellowship with thee: which frameth mischiefe by a lawe?
\p
\v 21 They gather themselues together against the soule of the righteous: and condemne the innocent blood.
\p
\v 22 But the Lord is my defence: and my God is the rocke of my refuge.
\p
\v 23 And hee shall bring vpon them their owne iniquitie, and shall cut them off in their owne wickednesse: yea the Lord our God shall cut them off.

\v 1 O come, let vs sing vnto the Lord: let vs make a ioyfull noise to the rocke of our saluation.
\p
\v 2 Let vs come before his presence with thanksgiuing: and make a ioyfull noise vnto him with psalmes.
\p
\v 3 For the Lord is a great God: and a great king aboue all Gods.
\p
\v 4 In his hand are the deepe places of the earth: the strength of the hilles is his also.
\p
\v 5 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.
\p
\v 6 O come, let vs worship and bowe downe: let vs kneele before the Lord our maker.
\p
\v 7 For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheepe of his hand: to day if yee will heare his voyce,
\p
\v 8 Harden not your heart, as in the prouocation: and as in the day of temptation, in the wildernesse:

\v 9 When your fathers tempted me: proued me, and sawe my worke.
\p
\v 10 Fortie yeeres long was I grieued with this generation: and sayd, It is a people that doe erre in their heart: and they haue not knowen my wayes.
\p
\v 11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath: that they should not enter into my rest.

\c 96
\p
\v 1 O sing vnto the Lord a new song: sing vnto the Lord all the earth.
\p
\v 2 Sing vnto the Lord, blesse his name: shew forth his saluation from day to day.
\p
\v 3 Declare his glory among the heathen: his wonders among all people.
\p
\v 4 For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: hee is to be feared aboue all Gods.
\p
\v 5 For all the gods of the nations are idoles: but the Lord made the heauens.
\p
\v 6 Honour and maiestie are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
\p
\v 7 Giue vnto the Lord (O yee kinreds of the people:) giue vnto the Lord glory and strength.
\p
\v 8 Giue vnto the Lord the glory due vnto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.
\p
\v 9 O worship the Lord, in the beautie of holinesse: feare before him all the earth.
\p
\v 10 Say among the heathen, that the Lord reigneth: the world also shalbe established that it shall not be moued: he shall iudge the people righteously.
\p
\v 11 Let the heauens reioyce, and let the earth be glad: let the sea roare, and the fulnesse thereof.
\p
\v 12 Let the field be ioyfull, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood reioyce
\p
\v 13 Before the Lord, for hee commeth, for hee commeth to iudge the earth: hee shall iudge the world with righteousnesse, and the people with his trueth.

\c 97
\p
\v 1 The Lord raigneth, let the earth reioyce: let the multitude of Isles bee glad thereof.
\p
\v 2 Clouds and darkenesse are round about him: righteousnesse and iudgement are the habitation of his throne.
\p
\v 3 A fire goeth before him: and burneth vp his enemies round about.
\p
\v 4 His lightnings inlightned the world: the earth sawe, and trembled.
\p
\v 5 The hilles melted like waxe at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
\p
\v 6 The heauens declare his righteousnesse: and all the people see his glory.
\p
\v 7 Confounded be all they that serue grauen images, that boast themselues of idoles: worship him all yee gods.
\p
\v 8 Sion heard, and was glad, and the daughters of Iudah reioyced: because of thy iudgements, O Lord.
\p
\v 9 For thou, Lord, art high aboue all the earth: thou art exalted farre aboue all gods.
\p
\v 10 Yee that loue the Lord, hate euil; hee preserueth the soules of his Saints: hee deliuereth them out of the hand of the wicked.
\p
\v 11 Light is sowen for the righteous: and gladnesse for the vpright in heart.
\p
\v 12 Reioyce in the Lord, ye righteous: and giue thanks at the remembrance of his holinesse.

\c 98
\p
\v 1 A Psalme. O sing vnto the Lord a New song, for hee hath done marueilous things: his right hand, and his holy arme hath gotten him the victorie.
\p
\v 2 The Lord hath made knowen his saluation: his righteousnesse hath hee openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.
\p
\v 3 Hee hath remembred his mercie and his trueth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth haue seene the saluation of our God.
\p
\v 4 Make a ioyfull noise vnto the Lord, all the earth: make a lowd noise, and reioyce, and sing praise.
\p
\v 5 Sing vnto the Lord with the harpe: with the harpe, and the voice of a Psalme.
\p
\v 6 With trumpets and sound of cornet: make a ioyfull noise before the Lord, the King.
\p
\v 7 Let the sea roare, and the fulnesse thereof: the world, and they that dwell therein.
\p
\v 8 Let the floods clap their handes: let the hilles be ioyfull together
\p
\v 9 Before the Lord, for he commeth to iudge the earth: with righteousnesse shall hee iudge the world, and the people with equitie.

\c 99
\p
\v 1 The Lord raigneth, let the people tremble: he sitteth betweene the Cherubims, let the earth bee mooued.
\p
\v 2 The Lord is great in Zion: and he is high aboue all people.
\p
\v 3 Let them praise thy great and terrible Name: for it is holy.
\p
\v 4 The Kings strength also loueth iudgement, thou doest establish equitie: thou executest iudgement and righteousnes in Iacob.
\p
\v 5 Exalt yee the Lord our God, and worship at his footstoole: for he is holy.
\p
\v 6 Moses and Aaron among his Priests, and Samuel among them that call vpon his Name: they called vpon the Lord, and he answered them.
\p
\v 7 He spake vnto them in the cloudie pillar: they kept his Testimonies, and the Ordinance that he gaue them.
\p
\v 8 Thou answeredst them, O Lord our God: thou wast a God that forgauest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inuentions.
\p
\v 9 Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy hill: for the Lord our God is holy.

\c 100
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of praise. Make a ioyfull noise vnto the Lord, all ye lands.
\p
\v 2 Serue the Lord with gladnes: come before his presence with singing.
\p
\v 3 Know ye that the Lord, hee is God, it is he that hath made vs, and not we our selues: wee are his people, and the sheepe of his pasture.
\p
\v 4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiuing, and into his Courts with praise: bee thankfull vnto him, and blesse his Name.
\p
\v 5 For the Lord is good, his mercy is euerlasting: and his trueth endureth to all generations.

\c 101
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. I will sing of Mercie and Iudgement: vnto thee, O Lord, wil I sing.
\p
\v 2 I will behaue my selfe wisely in a perfect way, O when wilt thou come vnto me? I will walke within my house with a perfect heart.
\p
\v 3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the worke of them that turne aside, it shal not cleaue to me.
\p
\v 4 A froward heart shall depart from me, I will not knowe a wicked person.
\p
\v 5 Whoso priuily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high looke, and a proud heart, will not I suffer.
\p
\v 6 Mine eyes shall be vpon the faithfull of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serue me.
\p
\v 7 He that worketh deceit, shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarie in my sight.
\p
\v 8 I will earely destroy all the wicked of the land: that I may cut off all wicked doers from the citie of the Lord.

\c 102
\p
\v 1 A prayer of the afflicted when he is ouerwhelmed, and powreth out his complaint before the Lord. Heare my prayer, O Lord: and let my crie come vnto thee.
\p
\v 2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble, incline thine eare vnto me: in the day when I call, answere mee speedily.
\p
\v 3 For my dayes are consumed like smoke: and my bones are burnt as an hearth.
\p
\v 4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grasse: so that I forget to eate my bread.
\p
\v 5 By reason of the voice of my groning, my bones cleaue to my skinne.
\p
\v 6 I am like a Pelican of the wildernes: I am like an owle of the desert.
\p
\v 7 I watch, and am as a sparowe alone vpon the house top.
\p
\v 8 Mine enemies reproch me all the day: and they that are mad against me, are sworne against me.
\p
\v 9 For I haue eaten ashes like bread: and mingled my drinke with weeping.
\p
\v 10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me vp, and cast me downe.
\p
\v 11 My dayes are like a shadow, that declineth: & I am withered like grasse.
\p
\v 12 But thou, O Lord, shalt endure for euer: and thy remembrance vnto all generations.
\p
\v 13 Thou shalt arise, and haue mercie vpon Zion: for the time to fauour her, yea the set time is come.
\p
\v 14 For thy seruants take pleasure in her stones: and fauour the dust therof.
\p
\v 15 So the heathen shall feare the Name of the Lord: and all the kings of the earth thy glory.
\p
\v 16 When the Lord shall build vp Zion: he shall appeare in his glory.
\p
\v 17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.
\p
\v 18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created, shall praise the Lord.
\p
\v 19 For hee hath looked downe from the height of his Sanctuarie: from heauen did the Lord beholde the earth:
\p
\v 20 To heare the groning of the prisoner: to loose those that are appointed to death:
\p
\v 21 To declare the Name of the Lord in Zion: and his praise in Ierusalem:
\p
\v 22 When the people are gathered together: and the kingdomes to serue the Lord.
\p
\v 23 He weakened my strength in the way: he shortened my dayes.
\p
\v 24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my dayes: thy yeres are throughout all generations.
\p
\v 25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heauens are the worke of thy hands.
\p
\v 26 They shall perish, but thou shalt indure, yea all of them shall waxe old like a garment: as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shalbe changed.
\p
\v 27 But thou art the same: and thy yeeres shall haue no end.
\p
\v 28 The children of thy seruants shal continue: and their seed shall be established before thee.

\c 103
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. Blesse the Lord, O my soule: and all that is within me, blesse his holy Name.
\p
\v 2 Blesse the Lord, O my soule: & forget not all his benefits.
\p
\v 3 Who forgiueth all thine iniquities: who healeth all thy diseases.
\p
\v 4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction: who crowneth thee with louing kindnesse and tender mercies.
\p
\v 5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things: so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagles.
\p
\v 6 The Lord executeth righteousnesse: and iudgement for all that are oppressed.
\p
\v 7 He made knowen his wayes vnto Moses: his actes vnto the children of Israel.
\p
\v 8 The Lord is mercifull and gracious: slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
\p
\v 9 Hee will not alwayes chide: neither will he keepe his anger for euer.
\p
\v 10 Hee hath not dealt with vs after our sinnes: nor rewarded vs according to our iniquities.
\p
\v 11 For as the heauen is high aboue the earth: so great is his mercy toward them that feare him.
\p
\v 12 As farre as the East is from the West: so farre hath hee remooued our transgressions from vs.
\p
\v 13 Like as a father pitieth his children: so the Lord pitieth them that feare him.
\p
\v 14 For he knoweth our frame: hee remembreth that we are dust.
\p
\v 15 As for man, his dayes are as grasse: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
\p
\v 16 For the winde passeth ouer it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.
\p
\v 17 But the mercy of the Lord is from euerlasting to euerlasting vpon them that feare him: and his righteousnesse vnto childrens children:
\p
\v 18 To such as keepe his couenant: and to those that remember his commandements to doe them.
\p
\v 19 The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heauens: and his kingdome ruleth ouer all.
\p
\v 20 Blesse the Lord yee his Angels, that excell in strength, that do his commandements: hearkening vnto the voice of his word.
\p
\v 21 Blesse ye the Lord all yee his hostes: ye ministers of his that doe his pleasure.
\p
\v 22 Blesse the Lord all his works in all places of his dominion: blesse the Lord, O my soule.

\c 104
\p
\v 1 Blesse the Lord, O my soule, O Lord my God, thou art very great: thou art clothed with honour and maiestie.
\p
\v 2 Who couerest thy selfe with light, as with a garment: who stretchest out the heauens like a curtaine.
\p
\v 3 Who layeth the beames of his chambers in the waters, who maketh the cloudes his charet: who walketh vpon the wings of the wind.
\p
\v 4 Who maketh his Angels spirits: his ministers a flaming fire.
\p
\v 5 Who laid the foundations of the earth: that it should not be remoued for euer.
\p
\v 6 Thou coueredst it with the deepe as with a garment: the waters stood aboue the mountaines.
\p
\v 7 At thy rebuke they fled: at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
\p
\v 8 They go vp by the mountaines: they goe downe by the valleys vnto the place which thou hast founded for them.
\p
\v 9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not passe ouer: that they turne not againe to couer the earth.
\p
\v 10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys: which runne among the hilles.
\p
\v 11 They giue drinke to euery beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.
\p
\v 12 By them shall the foules of the heauen haue their habitation: which sing among the branches.
\p
\v 13 He watereth the hilles from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy workes.
\p
\v 14 He causeth the grasse to grow for the cattell, and herbe for the seruice of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth:
\p
\v 15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oile to make his face to shine: and bread which strengtheneth mans heart.
\p
\v 16 The trees of the Lord are full of sappe: the cedars of Lebanon which he hath planted.
\p
\v 17 Where the birds make their nests: as for the Storke, the firre trees are her house.
\p
\v 18 The hie hilles are a refuge for the wilde goates: and the rockes for the conies.
\p
\v 19 He appointed the moone for seasons; the sunne knoweth his going downe.
\p
\v 20 Thou makest darknesse, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forrest doe creepe forth.
\p
\v 21 The young lyons roare after their pray: and seeke their meate from God.
\p
\v 22 The sunne ariseth, they gather themselues together: and lay them downe in their dennes.
\p
\v 23 Man goeth forth vnto his worke: and to his labour, vntill the euening.
\p
\v 24 O Lord, how manifold are thy workes! in wisedome hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.
\p
\v 25 So is this great and wide Sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable: both small and great beasts.
\p
\v 26 There goe the shippes; there is that Leuiathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.
\p
\v 27 These waite all vpon thee: that thou mayest giue them their meate in due season.
\p
\v 28 That thou giuest them, they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
\p
\v 29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled, thou takest away their breath, they die: and returne to their dust.
\p
\v 30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.
\p
\v 31 The glory of the Lord shall endure for euer: the Lord shall reioyce in his workes.
\p
\v 32 Hee looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the hilles, and they smoke.
\p
\v 33 I will sing vnto the Lord as long as I liue: I will sing praise to my God, while I haue my being.
\p
\v 34 My meditation of him shalbe sweete: I will be glad in the Lord.
\p
\v 35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked bee no more: blesse thou the Lord, O my soule. Praise yee the Lord.

\c 105
\p
\v 1 O giue thankes vnto the Lord, call vpon his name: make knowen his deeds among the people.
\p
\v 2 Sing vnto him; sing Psalmes vnto him: talke yee of all his wondrous workes.
\p
\v 3 Glory yee in his holy name: let the heart of them reioyce, that seeke the Lord.
\p
\v 4 Seeke the Lord, and his strength: seeke his face euermore.
\p
\v 5 Remember his maruellous workes, that hee hath done: his wonders, and the iudgements of his mouth,
\p
\v 6 O yee seede of Abraham his seruant: yee children of Iacob his chosen.
\p
\v 7 He is the Lord our God: his iudgements are in all the earth.
\p
\v 8 He hath remembred his couenant for euer: the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.
\p
\v 9 Which couenant he made with Abraham, and his oath vnto Isaac:
\p
\v 10 And confirmed the same vnto Iacob for a law: and to Israel for an euerlasting couenant:
\p
\v 11 Saying, Unto thee will I giue the land of Canaan: the lot of your inheritance.
\p
\v 12 When they were but a few men in number: yea very few, & strangers in it.
\p
\v 13 When they went from one nation to another: from one kingdome to another people.
\p
\v 14 He suffred no man to doe them wrong: yea he reproued kings for their sakes:
\p
\v 15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed; and doe my Prophets no harme.
\p
\v 16 Moreouer hee called for a famine vpon the land: he brake the whole staffe of bread.
\p
\v 17 Hee sent a man before them: euen Ioseph, who was sold for a seruant.
\p
\v 18 Whose feete they hurt with fetters: he was layd in iron.
\p
\v 19 Untill the time that his word came: the word of the Lord tried him.
\p
\v 20 The king sent and loosed him: euen the ruler of the people, and let him goe free.
\p
\v 21 Hee made him lord of his house: and ruler of all his substance:
\p
\v 22 To binde his princes at his pleasure: and teach his Senatours wisedome.
\p
\v 23 Israel also came into Egypt: and Iacob soiourned in the land of Ham.
\p
\v 24 And hee increased his people greatly: and made them stronger then their enemies.
\p
\v 25 He turned their heart to hate his people: to deale subtilly with his seruants.
\p
\v 26 Hee sent Moses his seruant: and Aaron whom he had chosen.
\p
\v 27 They shewed his signes among them: and wonders in the land of Ham.
\p
\v 28 Hee sent darknesse, and made it darke: and they rebelled not against his word.
\p
\v 29 Hee turned their waters into blood: and slew their fish.
\p
\v 30 The land brought foorth frogs in abundance: in the chambers of their kings.
\p
\v 31 He spake, and there came diuers sorts of flies: and lice in all their coasts.
\p
\v 32 Hee gaue them haile for raine: and flaming fire in their laud.
\p
\v 33 Hee smote their Uines also, and their figge trees: and brake the trees of their coastes.
\p
\v 34 He spake, and the locusts came: and catterpillers, and that without number,
\p
\v 35 And did eate vp all the herbes in their land: and deuoured the fruite of their ground.
\p
\v 36 Hee smote also all the first borne in their land: the chiefe of all their strength.
\p
\v 37 Hee brought them foorth also with siluer and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
\p
\v 38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the feare of them fell vpon them.
\p
\v 39 He spread a cloud for a couering: and fire to giue light in the night.
\p
\v 40 The people asked, and he brought quailes: and satisfied them with the bread of heauen.
\p
\v 41 He opened the rocke, and the waters gushed out: they ranne in the dry places like a riuer.
\p
\v 42 For he remembred his holy promise: and Abraham his seruant.
\p
\v 43 And he brought forth his people with ioy: and his chosen with gladnesse:
\p
\v 44 And gaue them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people:
\p
\v 45 That they might obserue his statutes, and keepe his Lawes, Praise ye the Lord.

\c 106
\p
\v 1 Praise ye the Lord. O giue thankes vnto the Lord, for he is good: for his mercie endureth for euer.
\p
\v 2 Who can vtter the mighty acts of the Lord? who can shew foorth all his praise?
\p
\v 3 Blessed are they that keepe iudgement: and he that doeth righteousnesse at all times.
\p
\v 4 Remember me, O Lord, with the fauour that thou bearest vnto thy people: O visite me with thy saluation:
\p
\v 5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may reioyce in the gladnesse of thy nation: that I may glory with thine inheritance.
\p
\v 6 Wee haue sinned with our fathers: we haue committed iniquitie, we haue done wickedly.
\p
\v 7 Our fathers vnderstood not thy wonders in Egypt, they remembred not the multitude of thy mercies: but prouoked him at the sea, euen at the Red-sea.
\p
\v 8 Neuerthelesse hee saued them for his Names sake: that hee might make his mighty power to be knowen.
\p
\v 9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried vp: so hee led them through the depthes, as through the wildernes.
\p
\v 10 And he saued them from the hand of him that hated them: and redeemed them from the hand of the enemie.
\p
\v 11 And the waters couered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
\p
\v 12 Then beleeued they his words: they sang his praise.
\p
\v 13 They soone forgate his works: they waited not for his counsell:
\p
\v 14 But lusted exceedingly in the wildernes: & tempted God in the desert.
\p
\v 15 And he gaue them their request: but sent leannesse into their soule.
\p
\v 16 They enuied Moses also in the campe: and Aaron the Saint of the Lord.
\p
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed vp Dathan: and couered the company of Abiram.
\p
\v 18 And a fire was kindled in their company: the flame burnt vp the wicked.
\p
\v 19 They made a calfe in Horeb: and worshipped the molten image.
\p
\v 20 Thus they changed their glory, into the similitude of an oxe that eateth grasse.
\p
\v 21 They forgate God their Sauiour: which had done great things in Egypt:
\p
\v 22 Wonderous workes in the lande of Ham: and terrible things by the red Sea.
\p
\v 23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach: to turne away his wrath, lest hee should destroy them.
\p
\v 24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land: they beleeued not his word:
\p
\v 25 But murmured in their tents: and hearkened not vnto the voyce of the Lord.
\p
\v 26 Therefore he lifted vp his hande against them: to ouerthrow them in the wildernesse:
\p
\v 27 To ouerthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
\p
\v 28 They ioyned themselues also vnto Baal-Peor: and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
\p
\v 29 Thus they prouoked him to anger with their inuentions: and the plague brake in vpon them.
\p
\v 30 Then stood vp Phinehas, and executed iudgement: and so the plague was stayed.
\p
\v 31 And that was counted vnto him for righteousnesse: vnto all generations for euermore.
\p
\v 32 They angred him also at the waters of strife: so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
\p
\v 33 Because they prouoked his spirit: so that hee spake vnaduisedly with his lippes.
\p
\v 34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them:
\p
\v 35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their workes.
\p
\v 36 And they serued their idoles: which were a snare vnto them.
\p
\v 37 Yea they sacrificed their sonnes, and their daughters vnto deuils,
\p
\v 38 And shed innocent blood, euen the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whome they sacrificed vnto the idoles of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
\p
\v 39 Thus were they defiled with their owne works: and went a whoring with their owne inuentions.
\p
\v 40 Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people: insomuch that he abhorred his owne inheritance.
\p
\v 41 And he gaue them into the hand of the heathen: and they that hated them, ruled ouer them.
\p
\v 42 Their enemies also oppressed them: and they were brought into subiection vnder their hand.
\p
\v 43 Many times did he deliuer them: but they prouoked him with their counsell, and were brought low for their iniquitie.
\p
\v 44 Neuertheles he regarded their affliction: when he heard their crie.
\p
\v 45 And hee remembred for them his couenant: and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
\p
\v 46 He made them also to be pitied, of all those that caried them captiues.
\p
\v 47 Saue vs, O Lord our God, and gather vs from among the heathen to giue thankes vnto thy holy Name: and to triumph in thy praise.
\p
\v 48 Blessed bee the Lord God of Israel from euerlasting to euerlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the Lord.

\c 107
\p
\v 1 O giue thankes vnto the Lord, for hee is good: for his mercie endureth for euer.
\p
\v 2 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so: whome he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemie:
\p
\v 3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the East and from the West: from the North and from the South.
\p
\v 4 They wandred in the wildernes, in a solitary way: they found no citie to dwell in.
\p
\v 5 Hungry and thirstie: their soule fainted in them.
\p
\v 6 Then they cryed vnto the Lord in their trouble: and he deliuered them out of their distresses.
\p
\v 7 And hee led them forth by the right way: that they might goe to a citie of habitation.
\p
\v 8 Oh that men would praise the Lord, for his goodnesse: and for his wonderfull workes to the children of men.
\p
\v 9 For he satisfieth the longing soule: and filleth the hungry soule with goodnesse.
\p
\v 10 Such as sit in darknesse and in the shadowe of death: being bound in affliction and yron:
\p
\v 11 Because they rebelled against the words of God: and contemned the counsell of the most high:
\p
\v 12 Therefore hee brought downe their heart with labour: they fel downe, and there was none to helpe.
\p
\v 13 Then they cryed vnto the Lord in their trouble: and he saued them out of their distresses.
\p
\v 14 Hee brought them out of darkenesse, and the shadowe of death: and brake their bands insunder.
\p
\v 15 Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodnesse: and for his wonderfull workes to the children of men.
\p
\v 16 For he hath broken the gates of brasse: and cut the barres of yron in sunder.
\p
\v 17 Fooles, because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
\p
\v 18 Their soule abhorreth all manner of meate: and they drawe neere vnto the gates of death.
\p
\v 19 Then they crie vnto the Lord in their trouble: he saueth them out of their distresses.
\p
\v 20 Hee sent his word, and healed them: and deliuered them from their destructions.
\p
\v 21 Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodnesse: and for his wonderfull workes, to the children of men.
\p
\v 22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thankesgiuing: and declare his workes with reioycing.
\p
\v 23 They that goe downe to the sea in shippes: that doe businesse in great waters:
\p
\v 24 These see the workes of the Lord: and his wonders in the deepe.
\p
\v 25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy winde: which lifteth vp the waues thereof.
\p
\v 26 They mount vp to the heauen: they goe downe againe to the depthes: their soule is melted because of trouble.
\p
\v 27 They reele to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man; and are at their wits end.
\p
\v 28 Then they cry vnto the Lord in their trouble: and hee bringeth them out of their distresses.
\p
\v 29 He maketh the storme a calme: so that the waues thereof are still.
\p
\v 30 Then are they glad, because they be quiet: so he bringeth them vnto their desired hauen.
\p
\v 31 Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodnesse; and for his wonderfull workes to the children of men:
\p
\v 32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the Elders.
\p
\v 33 Hee turneth riuers into a wildernesse: and the water springs into dry ground:
\p
\v 34 A fruitfull land into barrennesse; for the wickednesse of them that dwell therein.
\p
\v 35 He turneth the wildernesse into a standing water: and dry ground into water-springs.
\p
\v 36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell; that they may prepare a citie for habitation,
\p
\v 37 And sowe the fields, and plant vineyards; which may yeeld fruits of increase.
\p
\v 38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly: and suffreth not their cattell to decrease.
\p
\v 39 Againe, they are minished and brought lowe through oppression, affliction and sorrow.
\p
\v 40 Hee powreth contempt vpon princes: and causeth them to wander in the wildernesse, where there is no way.
\p
\v 41 Yet setteth he the poore on high from affliction: and maketh him families like a flocke.
\p
\v 42 The righteous shall see it, and reioyce; and all iniquitie shall stop her mouth.
\p
\v 43 Who so is wise, and will obserue those things; euen they shall vnderstand the louing kindenesse of the Lord.

\v 1 A song or Psalme of Dauid. O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing & giue praise, euen with my glory.
\p
\v 2 Awake psaltery and harpe: I my selfe will awake early.
\p
\v 3 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: and I wil sing praises vnto thee among the nations.
\p
\v 4 For thy mercy is great aboue the heauens: and thy trueth reacheth vnto the clouds.
\p
\v 5 Be thou exalted, O God, aboue the heauens: and thy glory aboue all the earth:
\p
\v 6 That thy beloued may bee deliuered: saue with thy right hand, and answere me.
\p
\v 7 God hath spoken in his holinesse, I wil reioyce, I will diuide Shechem: and mete out the valley of Succoth.
\p
\v 8 Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine, Ephraim also is the strength of mine head: Iudah is my Lawgiuer.
\p
\v 9 Moab is my wash pot, ouer Edom wil I cast out my shooe: ouer Philistia will I triumph.
\p
\v 10 Who wil bring me into the strong citie? who will leade me into Edom?
\p
\v 11 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast vs off? and wilt not thou, O God, goe foorth with our hostes?
\p
\v 12 Giue vs helpe from trouble: for vaine is the helpe of man.
\p
\v 13 Through God wee shall doe valiantly: for hee it is that shall tread downe our enemies.

\c 109
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician, A Psalme of Dauid. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise.
\p
\v 2 For the mouth of the wicked, and the mouth of the deceitfull are opened against mee: they haue spoken against me with a lying tongue.
\p
\v 3 They compassed mee about also with wordes of hatred: and fought against me without a cause.
\p
\v 4 For my loue, they are my aduersaries: but I giue my selfe vnto prayer.
\p
\v 5 And they haue rewarded me euill for good: and hatred for my loue.
\p
\v 6 Set thou a wicked man ouer him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.
\p
\v 7 When he shall be iudged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sinne.
\p
\v 8 Let his dayes be few: and let another take his office.
\p
\v 9 Let his children bee fatherlesse: and his wife a widow.
\p
\v 10 Let his children bee continually vagabonds, & begge: let them seeke their bread also out of their desolate places.
\p
\v 11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath: and let the strangers spoile his labour.
\p
\v 12 Let there be none to extend mercy vnto him: neither let there be any to fauour his fatherlesse children.
\p
\v 13 Let his posteritie be cut off: and in the generation folowing let their name be blotted out.
\p
\v 14 Let the iniquitie of his fathers be remembred with the Lord: and let not the sinne of his mother be blotted out.
\p
\v 15 Let them be before the Lord continually: that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
\p
\v 16 Because that he remembred not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poore and needy man: that he might euen slay the broken in heart.
\p
\v 17 As he loued cursing, so let it come vnto him: as hee delighted not in blessing, so let it be farre from him.
\p
\v 18 As he clothed himselfe with cursing like as with his garment: so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oyle into his bones.
\p
\v 19 Let it be vnto him as the garment which couereth him: and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
\p
\v 20 Let this be the reward of mine aduersaries from the Lord: and of them that speake euill against my soule.
\p
\v 21 But do thou for me, O God the Lord, for thy Names sake: because thy mercie is good: deliuer thou me.
\p
\v 22 For I am poore and needie: and my heart is wounded within me.
\p
\v 23 I am gone like the shadow, when it declineth: I am tossed vp and downe as the locust.
\p
\v 24 My knees are weake through fasting: and my flesh faileth of fatnesse.
\p
\v 25 I became also a reproch vnto them: when they looked vpon me, they shaked their heads.
\p
\v 26 Helpe me, O Lord my God: O saue me according to thy mercie.
\p
\v 27 That they may know, that this is thy hand: that thou, Lord, hast done it.
\p
\v 28 Let them curse, but blesse thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed, but let thy seruant reioyce.
\p
\v 29 Let mine aduersaries be clothed with shame: and let them couer them selues with their owne confusion, as with a mantle.
\p
\v 30 I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth: yea I will praise him among the multitude.
\p
\v 31 For he shal stand at the right hand of the poore: to saue him from those that condemne his soule.

\c 110
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. The Lord said vnto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand: vntil I make thine enemies thy footestoole.
\p
\v 2 The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
\p
\v 3 Thy people shalbe willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holinesse from the wombe of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.
\p
\v 4 The Lord hath sworne, and will not repent, thou art a Priest for euer: after the order of Melchizedek.
\p
\v 5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.
\p
\v 6 He shal iudge among the heathen, he shal fil the places with the dead bodies: he shall wound the heads ouer many countries.
\p
\v 7 He shall drinke of the brooke in the way: therefore shall hee lift vp the head.

\c 111
\p
\v 1 Praise yee the Lord. I will praise the Lord with my whole heart: in the assembly of the vpright, and in the Congregation.
\p
\v 2 The workes of the Lord are great: sought out of all them that haue pleasure therein.
\p
\v 3 His worke is honourable and glorious: and his righteousnesse endureth for euer.
\p
\v 4 Hee hath made his wonderfull works to be remembred: the Lord is gracious, and full of compassion.
\p
\v 5 He hath giuen meate vnto them that feare him: he will euer be mindfull of his couenant.
\p
\v 6 He hath shewed his people the power of his workes: that he may giue them the heritage of the heathen.
\p
\v 7 The works of his hands are veritie and iudgment: all his commandements are sure.
\p
\v 8 They stand fast for euer and euer: and are done in trueth and vprightnes.
\p
\v 9 He sent redemption vnto his people, hee hath commanded his couenant for euer: holy and reuerend is his Name.
\p
\v 10 The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wisedome, a good vnderstanding haue all they that doe his commandements: his praise endureth for euer.

\c 112
\p
\v 1 Praise ye the Lord. Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in his Commaundements.
\p
\v 2 His seed shall bee mightie vpon earth: the generation of the vpright shalbe blessed.
\p
\v 3 Wealth and riches shalbe in his house: and his righteousnesse endureth for euer.
\p
\v 4 Unto the vpright there ariseth light in the darknesse: hee is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.
\p
\v 5 A good man sheweth fauour and lendeth: he will guide his affaires with discretion.
\p
\v 6 Surely he shall not be moued for euer: the righteous shalbe in euerlasting remembrance.
\p
\v 7 He shall not be afraid of euill tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.
\p
\v 8 His heart is established, hee shall not be afraid, vntill he see his desire vpon his enemies.
\p
\v 9 He hath dispersed, he hath giuen to the poore: his righteousnesse endureth for euer; his horne shalbe exalted with honour.
\p
\v 10 The wicked shall see it, and be grieued; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.

\c 113
\p
\v 1 Praise yee the Lord. Praise, O yee seruants of the Lord: praise the name of the Lord.
\p
\v 2 Blessed be the name of the Lord: from this time forth and for euermore.
\p
\v 3 From the rising of the sunne vnto the going downe of the same: the Lords name is to be praised.
\p
\v 4 The Lord is high aboue all nations: and his glory aboue the heauens.
\p
\v 5 Who is like vnto the Lord our God: who dwelleth on high:
\p
\v 6 Who humbleth himselfe to behold the things that are in heauen, and in the earth?
\p
\v 7 He raiseth vp the poore out of the dust: and lifteth the needie out of the dung-hill:
\p
\v 8 That he may set him with princes: euen with the princes of his people.
\p
\v 9 He maketh the barren woman to keepe house; to be a ioyfull mother of children: Praise yee the Lord.

\c 114
\p
\v 1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Iacob from a people of strange language:
\p
\v 2 Iudah was his sanctuarie: and Israel his dominion.
\p
\v 3 The sea sawe it, and fled: Iordan was driuen backe.
\p
\v 4 The mountaines skipped like rammes: and the little hilles like lambes.
\p
\v 5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Iordan, that thou wast driuen backe?
\p
\v 6 Yee mountaines, that yee skipped like rammes: and yee little hilles like lambes?
\p
\v 7 Tremble thou earth at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the God of Iacob:
\p
\v 8 Which turned the rocke into a standing water: the flint into a fountaine of waters.

\c 115
\p
\v 1 Not vnto vs, O Lord, not vnto vs, but vnto thy name giue glory: for thy mercy, and for thy truthes sake.
\p
\v 2 Wherefore should the heathen say: Where is now their God?
\p
\v 3 But our God is in the heauens: he hath done whatsoeuer he pleased.
\p
\v 4 Their idoles are siluer and gold: the worke of mens hands.
\p
\v 5 They haue mouths, but they speake not; eies haue they, but they see not.
\p
\v 6 They haue eares, but they heare not: noses haue they, but they smell not.
\p
\v 7 They haue hands, but they handle not, feete haue they, but they walke not: neither speake they through their throat.
\p
\v 8 They that make them are like vnto them: so is euery one that trusteth in them.
\p
\v 9 O Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their helpe and their shield.
\p
\v 10 O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord: he is their helpe & their shield.
\p
\v 11 Ye that feare the Lord trust in the Lord: he is their helpe and their shield.
\p
\v 12 The Lord hath bene mindfull of vs, he will blesse vs, he will blesse the house of Israel: he will blesse the house of Aaron.
\p
\v 13 Hee will blesse them that feare the Lord: both small and great.
\p
\v 14 The Lord shall increase you more and more: you and your children.
\p
\v 15 You are blessed of the Lord: which made heauen and earth.
\p
\v 16 The heauen, euen the heauens are the Lords: but the earth hath hee giuen to the children of men.
\p
\v 17 The dead praise not the Lord: neither any that go downe into silence.
\p
\v 18 But we will blesse the Lord, from this time foorth and for euermore. Praise the Lord.

\c 116
\p
\v 1 I loue the Lord: because hee hath heard my voice, & my supplications.
\p
\v 2 Because hee hath inclined his eare vnto mee: therefore will I call vpon him as long as I liue.
\p
\v 3 The sorrowes of death compassed me, and the paines of hell gate hold vpon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
\p
\v 4 Then called I vpon the Name of the Lord: O Lord, I beseech thee deliuer my soule.
\p
\v 5 Gracious is the Lord, and righteous: yea our God is mercifull.
\p
\v 6 The Lord preserueth the simple: I was brought low, and hee helped me.
\p
\v 7 Returne vnto thy rest, O my soule: for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.
\p
\v 8 For thou hast deliuered my soule from death, mine eyes from teares, and my feete from falling.
\p
\v 9 I wil walke before the Lord: in the land of the liuing.
\p
\v 10 I beleeued, therfore haue I spoken: I was greatly afflicted.
\p
\v 11 I said in my haste: All men are lyers.
\p
\v 12 What shall I render vnto the Lord: for all his benefits towards mee?
\p
\v 13 I will take the cup of saluation: and call vpon the Name of the Lord.
\p
\v 14 I will pay my vowes vnto the Lord: now in the presence of all his people.
\p
\v 15 Precious in &thorn;e sight of the Lord: is the death of his Saints.
\p
\v 16 Oh Lord, truely I am thy seruant, I am thy seruant, and the sonne of thy handmayde: thou hast loosed my bonds.
\p
\v 17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thankes-giuing: and will call vpon the Name of the Lord.
\p
\v 18 I will pay my vowes vnto the Lord: now in the presence of all his people:
\p
\v 19 In the Courts of the Lords house, in the middes of thee, O Ierusalem. Praise ye the Lord.

\c 117
\p
\v 1 O praise the Lord, all ye nations: praise him all ye people.
\p
\v 2 For his merciful kindnesse is great toward vs: and the trueth of the Lord endureth for euer. Praise ye the Lord.

\c 118
\p
\v 1 O giue thankes vnto the Lord, for hee is good: because his mercie endureth for euer.
\p
\v 2 Let Israel now say: that his mercy endureth for euer.
\p
\v 3 Let the house of Aaron now say: that his mercy endureth for euer.
\p
\v 4 Let them now that feare the Lord, say: that his mercy endureth for euer.
\p
\v 5 I called vpon the Lord in distresse: the Lord answered me, and set me in a large place.
\p
\v 6 The Lord is on my side, I will not feare: What can man doe vnto mee?
\p
\v 7 The Lord taketh my part with them that helpe me: therfore shall I see my desire vpon them that hate me.
\p
\v 8 It is better to trust in the Lord: then to put confidence in man.
\p
\v 9 It is better to trust in the Lord: then to put confidence in Princes.
\p
\v 10 All nations compassed me about: but in the Name of the Lord, will I destroy them.
\p
\v 11 They compassed mee about, yea they compassed mee about: but in the Name of the Lord, I will destroy them.
\p
\v 12 They compassed mee about like Bees, they are quenched as the fire of thornes: for in the Name of the Lord I wil destroy them.
\p
\v 13 Thou hast thrust sore at mee that I might fall: but the Lord helped mee.
\p
\v 14 The Lord is my strength and song: and is become my saluation.
\p
\v 15 The voice of reioycing and saluation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the Right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly.
\p
\v 16 The Right hand of the Lord is exalted: the Right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly.
\p
\v 17 I shall not die, but liue: and declare the workes of the Lord.
\p
\v 18 The Lord hath chastened me sore: but he hath not giuen me ouer vnto death.
\p
\v 19 Open to mee the gates of righteousnesse: I will goe into them, and I will praise the Lord:
\p
\v 20 This gate of the Lord: into which the righteous shall enter.
\p
\v 21 I will praise thee, for thou hast heard mee: and art become my saluation.
\p
\v 22 The stone which the builders refused: is become the head stone of the corner.
\p
\v 23 This is the Lords doing: it is marueilous in our eyes.
\p
\v 24 This is the day which the Lord hath made: we will reioyce, and be glad in it.
\p
\v 25 Saue now, I beseech thee, O Lord: O Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperitie.
\p
\v 26 Blessed be he that commeth in the Name of the Lord: wee haue blessed you out of the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 27 God is the Lord, which hath shewed vs light, bind the sacrifice with cords: euen vnto the horns of the Altar.
\p
\v 28 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.

\p
\v 20 My soule breaketh for the longing: that it hath vnto thy iudgements at all times.
\p
\v 21 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed: which doe erre from thy Commandements.
\p
\v 22 Remooue from me reproch and contempt: for I haue kept thy testimonies.
\p
\v 23 Princes also did sit and speake against me: but thy seruant did meditate in thy statutes.

\v 49 ZAIN. Remember the word vnto thy seruant: vpon which thou hast caused me to hope.
\p
\v 50 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.
\p
\v 51 The proud haue had mee greatly in derision: yet haue I not declined from thy Law.
\p
\v 52 I remembred thy iudgements of old, O Lord: and haue comforted my selfe.
\p
\v 53 Horrour hath taken holde vpon me, because of the wicked that forsake thy Law.
\p
\v 54 Thy statutes haue bin my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
\p
\v 55 I haue remembred thy name, O Lord, in the night, and haue kept thy Law.
\p
\v 56 This I had: because I kept thy precepts.
\p
\v 57 CHETH. Thou art my portion, O Lord, I haue said, that I would keepe thy words.
\p
\v 58 I intreated thy fauour with my whole heart: be mercifull vnto mee according to thy word.
\p
\v 59 I thought on my wayes: and turned my feete vnto thy Testimonies.
\p
\v 60 I made haste; and delayed not to keepe thy commandements.
\p
\v 61 The bands of the wicked haue robbed me: but I haue not forgotten thy lawe.
\p
\v 62 At mid-night I will rise to giue thankes vnto thee: because of thy righteous iudgements.
\p
\v 63 I am a companion of all them that feare thee: and of them that keepe thy precepts.
\p
\v 64 The earth, O Lord, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.
\p
\v 65 TETH. Thou hast dealt well with thy seruant, Oh Lord, according vnto thy word.
\p
\v 66 Teach me good iudgement and knowledge: for I haue beleeued thy commandements.
\p
\v 67 Before I was afflicted, I went astray: but now haue I kept thy word.
\p
\v 68 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.
\p
\v 69 The proud haue forged a lie against me: but I will keepe thy precepts with my whole heart.
\p
\v 70 Their heart is as fat as grease: but I delight in thy law.
\p
\v 71 It is good for me that I haue bene afflicted: that I might learne thy statutes.
\p
\v 72 The law of thy mouth is better vnto me: then thousands of gold and siluer.
\p
\v 73 IOD. Thy hands haue made me and fashioned me: giue me vnderstanding, that I may learne thy commandements.
\p
\v 74 They that feare thee will bee glad when they see mee: because I haue hoped in thy word.
\p
\v 75 I knowe, O Lord, that thy iudgements are right: and that thou in faithfulnesse hast afflicted me.
\p
\v 76 Let, I pray thee, thy mercifull kindnesse be for my comfort; according to thy word vnto thy seruant.
\p
\v 77 Let thy tender mercies come vnto me, that I may liue: for thy lawe is my delight.
\p
\v 78 Let the proud be ashamed, for they dealt peruersly with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.
\p
\v 79 Let those that feare thee turne vnto me: and those that haue knowen thy testimonies.
\p
\v 80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.
\p
\v 81 CAPH. My soule fainteth for thy saluation: but I hope in thy word.
\p
\v 82 Mine eyes faile for thy word: saying, When wilt thou comfort me?
\p
\v 83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke: yet doe I not forget thy statutes.
\p
\v 84 How many are the dayes of thy seruant? when wilt thou execute iudgement on them that persecute me?
\p
\v 85 The proud haue digged pittes for me: which are not after thy law.
\p
\v 86 All thy commaundements are faithfull: they persecute me wrongfully; helpe thou me.
\p
\v 87 They had almost consumed mee vpon earth: but I forsooke not thy precepts.
\p
\v 88 Quicken mee after thy louing kindnesse: so shall I keepe the testimonie of thy mouth.
\p
\v 89 LAMED. Foreuer, O Lord, thy word is setled, in heauen.
\p
\v 90 Thy faithfulnesse is vnto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.
\p
\v 91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy seruants.
\p
\v 92 Unlesse thy lawe had bene my delights: I should then haue perished in mine affliction.
\p
\v 93 I will neuer forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.
\p
\v 94 I am thine, saue me: for I haue sought thy precepts.
\p
\v 95 The wicked haue waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.
\p
\v 96 I haue seene an end of all perfection: but thy commandement is exceeding broad.
\p
\v 97 MEM. O How loue I thy Law! it is my meditation all the day.
\p
\v 98 Thou through thy Commandements hast made me wiser then mine enemies: for they are euer with mee.
\p
\v 99 I haue more vnderstanding then all my teachers: for thy Testimonies are my meditation.
\p
\v 100 I vnderstand more then the ancients: because I keepe thy precepts.
\p
\v 101 I haue refrained my feete from euery euill way: that I may keepe thy word.
\p
\v 102 I haue not departed from thy Iudgements: for thou hast taught me.
\p
\v 103 How sweet are thy words vnto my taste! yea, sweeter then hony to my mouth.
\p
\v 104 Through thy precepts I get vnderstanding: therefore I hate euery false way.
\p
\v 105 NVN. Thy word is a lampe vnto my feete: and a light vnto my path.
\p
\v 106 I haue sworne, and I will performe it: that I will keepe thy righteous iudgements.
\p
\v 107 I am afflicted very much: quicken mee, O Lord, according vnto thy word.
\p
\v 108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewil offrings of my mouth, O Lord: and teach me thy iudgements.
\p
\v 109 My soule is continually in my hand: yet doe I not forget thy Law.
\p
\v 110 The wicked haue layde a snare for mee: yet I erred not from thy precepts.
\p
\v 111 Thy Testimonies haue I taken as an heritage for euer: for they are the reioycing of my heart.
\p
\v 112 I haue inclined mine heart to performe thy Statutes, alway, euen vnto the end.
\p
\v 113 SAMECH. I hate vaine thoughts: but thy Law doe I loue.
\p
\v 114 Thou art my hiding place, and my shield: I hope in thy word.
\p
\v 115 Depart from me, ye euil doers: for I will keepe the Commandements of my God.
\p
\v 116 Uphold mee according vnto thy word, that I may liue: and let mee not be ashamed of my hope.
\p
\v 117 Hold thou me vp, and I shall be safe: and I will haue respect vnto thy Statutes continually.
\p
\v 118 Thou hast troden downe all them that erre from thy Statutes: for their deceit is falshood.
\p
\v 119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like drosse: therefore I loue thy Testimonies.
\p
\v 120 My flesh trembleth for feare of thee: and I am afraide of thy Iudgements.
\p
\v 121 AIN. I Haue done Iudgement and iustice: leaue mee not to mine oppressours.
\p
\v 122 Bee suretie for thy seruant for good: let not the proud oppresse me.
\p
\v 123 Mine eyes faile for thy saluation: and for the word of thy righteousnesse.
\p
\v 124 Deale with thy seruant according vnto thy mercie: and teach me thy Statutes.
\p
\v 125 I am thy seruant, giue me vnderstanding: that I may know thy Testimonies.
\p
\v 126 It is time for thee, Lord, to worke: for they haue made voyde thy Law.
\p
\v 127 Therefore I loue thy Commandements: aboue gold, yea aboue fine gold.
\p
\v 128 Therefore I esteeme all thy precepts concerning all things to be right: and I hate euery false way.
\p
\v 129 PE. Thy Testimonies are wonderfull: therefore doeth my soule keepe them.
\p
\v 130 The entrance of thy wordes giueth light: it giueth vnderstanding vnto the simple.
\p
\v 131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy Commandements.
\p
\v 132 Looke thou vpon mee, and be mercifull vnto me: as thou vsest to do vnto those that loue thy Name.
\p
\v 133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquitie haue dominion ouer me.
\p
\v 134 Deliuer me from the oppression of man: so will I keepe thy precepts.
\p
\v 135 Make thy face to shine vpon thy seruant: and teach me thy Statutes.
\p
\v 136 Riuers of waters runne downe mine eyes: because they keepe not thy Law.
\p
\v 137 TSADDI. Righteous art thou, O Lord: and vpright are thy iudgements.
\p
\v 138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commaunded, are righteous: and very faithfull.
\p
\v 139 My zeale hath consumed me: because mine enemies haue forgotten thy words.
\p
\v 140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy seruant loueth it.
\p
\v 141 I am small and despised: yet doe not I forget thy precepts.
\p
\v 142 Thy righteousnesse is an euerlasting righteousnesse: and thy law is the trueth.
\p
\v 143 Trouble and anguish haue taken hold on me: yet thy commaundements are my delights.
\p
\v 144 The righteousnesse of thy Testimonies is euerlasting: giue me vnderstanding, and I shall liue.
\p
\v 145 KOPH. I Cried with my whole heart: heare me, O Lord, I will keepe thy statutes.
\p
\v 146 I cried vnto thee, saue me: and I shall keepe thy testimonies.
\p
\v 147 I preuented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.
\p
\v 148 Mine eyes preuent the night watches: that I might meditate in thy word.
\p
\v 149 Heare my voice according vnto thy louing kindnesse: O Lord quicken me according to thy iudgement.
\p
\v 150 They draw nigh that follow after mischiefe: they are farre from thy Law.
\p
\v 151 Thou art neere, O Lord: and all thy commandements are trueth.
\p
\v 152 Concerning thy testimonies, I haue knowen of old: that thou hast founded them for euer.
\p
\v 153 RESH. Consider mine affliction, and deliuer me: for I doe not forget thy Law.
\p
\v 154 Plead my cause, and deliuer me: quicken me according to thy word.
\p
\v 155 Saluation is farre from the wicked: for they seeke not thy statutes.
\p
\v 156 Great are thy tender mercies, O Lord: quicken me according to thy iudgements.
\p
\v 157 Many are my persecutors, and mine enemies: yet doe I not decline from thy testimonies.
\p
\v 158 I beheld the transgressours, and was grieued: because they kept not thy word.
\p
\v 159 Consider how I loue thy precepts: quicken me, O Lord, according to thy louing kindnesse.
\p
\v 160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and euery one of thy righteous iudgements endureth for euer.
\p
\v 161 SCHIN. Princes haue persecuted mee without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.
\p
\v 162 I reioyce at thy word: as one that findeth great spoile.
\p
\v 163 I hate and abhorre lying: but thy Law doe I loue.
\p
\v 164 Seuen times a day doe I praise thee: because of thy righteous iudgements.
\p
\v 165 Great peace haue they which loue thy law: & nothing shall offend them.
\p
\v 166 Lord, I haue hoped for thy saluation: and done thy commandements.
\p
\v 167 My soule hath kept thy testimonies: and I loue them exceedingly.
\p
\v 168 I haue kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my wayes are before thee.
\p
\v 169 TAV. Let my crie come neere before thee, O Lord: giue mee vnderstanding according to thy worde.
\p
\v 170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliuer me according to thy word.
\p
\v 171 My lips shall vtter praise: when thou hast taught me thy Statutes.
\p
\v 172 My tongue shall speake of thy word: for all thy commandements are righteousnesse.
\p
\v 173 Let thine hand helpe me: for I haue chosen thy precepts.
\p
\v 174 I haue longed for thy saluation, O Lord: and thy Lawe is my delight.
\p
\v 175 Let my soule liue, and it shall praise thee: and let thy iudgments helpe me.
\p
\v 176 I haue gone astray like a lost sheepe, seeke thy seruant: for I doe not forget thy commandements.

\p
\v 2 Deliuer my soule, O Lord, from lying lips: and from a deceitfull tongue.
\p
\v 3 What shall be giuen vnto thee? or what shalbe done vnto thee, thou false tongue?
\p
\v 4 Sharpe arrowes of the mightie: with coales of iuniper.
\p
\v 5 Woe is me, that I soiourne in Mesech: that I dwell in the tents of Kedar.
\p
\v 6 My soule hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
\p
\v 7 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for warre.

\p
\v 2 My helpe commeth from the Lord: which made heauen and earth.
\p
\v 3 He will not suffer thy foote to bee moued: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.
\p
\v 4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel; shall neither slumber nor sleepe.
\p
\v 5 The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade, vpon thy right hand.
\p
\v 6 The sunne shall not smite thee by day; nor the moone by night.
\p
\v 7 The Lord shall preserue thee from all euill: hee shall preserue thy soule.

\p
\v 1 A song of degrees of Dauid. I was glad when they sayd vnto me: Let vs goe into the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 2 Our feete shall stand within thy gates, O Ierusalem.
\p
\v 3 Ierusalem is builded as a citie, that is compact together:
\p
\v 4 Whither the tribes goe vp, the tribes of the Lord, vnto the testimonie of Israel: to giue thankes vnto the name of the Lord.
\p
\v 5 For there are set thrones of iudgment: the thrones of the house of Dauid.
\p
\v 6 Pray for the peace of Ierusalem: they shall prosper that loue thee.
\p
\v 7 Peace be within thy walles: and prosperitie within thy palaces.
\p
\v 8 For my brethren and companions sakes: I will now say, Peace be within thee.
\p
\v 9 Because of the house of the Lord our God: I will seeke thy good.

\c 123
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. Vnto thee lift I vp mine eyes: O thou that dwellest in the heauens.
\p
\v 2 Beholde, as the eyes of seruants looke vnto the hand of their Masters, and as the eyes of a maiden, vnto the hand of her mistresse: so our eyes waite vpon the Lord our God, vntill that he haue mercy vpon vs.
\p
\v 3 Haue mercy vpon vs, O Lord, haue mercy vpon vs: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
\p
\v 4 Our soule is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease: and with the contempt of the proud.

\c 124
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees of Dauid. If it had not bene the Lord who was on our side: nowe may Israel say:
\p
\v 2 If it had not bene the Lord, who was on our side, when men rose vp against vs:
\p
\v 3 Then they had swallowed vs vp quicke: when their wrath was kindled against vs.
\p
\v 4 Then the waters had ouerwhelmed vs; the streame had gone ouer our soule.
\p
\v 5 Then the proud waters had gone ouer our soule.
\p
\v 6 Blessed be the Lord: who hath not giuen vs as a pray to their teeth.
\p
\v 7 Our soule is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the foulers; the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
\p
\v 8 Our helpe is in the name of the Lord: who made heauen and earth.

\v 1 A song of degrees. They that trust in the Lord, shalbe as mount Zion, which cannot be remooued, but abideth for euer.
\p
\v 2 As the mountaines are round about Ierusalem, so the Lord is round about his people: from hencefoorth euen for euer.
\p
\v 3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest vpon the lot of the righteous: lest the righteous put forth their hands vnto iniquitie.
\p
\v 4 Doe good, O Lord, vnto those that be good: and to them that are vpright in their hearts.
\p
\v 5 As for such as turne aside vnto their crooked wayes, the Lord shall lead them foorth with the workers of iniquitie: but peace shalbe vpon Israel.

\c 126
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. When the Lord turned againe the captiuitie of Zion: wee were like them that dreame.
\p
\v 2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing, then said they among the heathen: The Lord hath done great things for them.
\p
\v 3 The Lord hath done great things for vs: whereof we are glad.
\p
\v 4 Turne againe our captiuitie, O Lord: as the streames in the South.
\p
\v 5 They that sow in teares: shall reape in ioy.
\p
\v 6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtlesse come againe with reioycing: bringing his sheaues with him.

\c 127
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees for Solomon. Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vaine that build it: except the Lord keepe the citie, the watchman waketh but in vaine.
\p
\v 2 It is vaine for you to rise vp early, to sit vp late, to eate the bread of sorrowes: for so hee giueth his beloued sleepe.
\p
\v 3 Loe, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the wombe is his reward.
\p
\v 4 As arrowes are in the hand of a mightie man: so are children of the youth.
\p
\v 5 Happie is the man that hath his quiuer full of them, they shall not be ashamed: but they shall speake with the enemies in the gate.

\c 128
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. Blessed is euery one that feareth the Lord: that walketh in his wayes.
\p
\v 2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine handes: happie shalt thou bee, and it shall be well with thee.
\p
\v 3 Thy wife shalbe as a fruitful Uine by the sides of thine house, thy children like Oliue plants: round about thy table.
\p
\v 4 Beholde that thus shall the man be blessed; that feareth the Lord.
\p
\v 5 The Lord shall blesse thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Ierusalem, all the dayes of thy life.
\p
\v 6 Yea, thou shalt see thy childrens children: and peace vpon Israel.

\c 129
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. Many a time haue they afflicted me from my youth: may Israel now say.
\p
\v 2 Many a time haue they afflicted me from my youth: yet they haue not preuailed against mee.
\p
\v 3 The plowers plowed vpon my backe: they made long their furrowes.
\p
\v 4 The Lord is righteous: hee hath cut asunder the cordes of the wicked.
\p
\v 5 Let them all be confounded and turned backe, that hate Zion.
\p
\v 6 Let them bee as the grasse vpon the house tops: which withereth afore it groweth vp:
\p
\v 7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand: nor hee that bindeth sheaues, his bosome.
\p
\v 8 Neither doe they which goe by, say, The blessing of the Lord be vpon you: wee blesse you in the Name of the Lord.

\c 130
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. Out of the depths haue I cryed vnto thee, O Lord.
\p
\v 2 Lorde, heare my voice: let thine eares be attentiue to the voice of my supplications.
\p
\v 3 If thou, Lord, shouldest marke iniquities: O Lord, who shal stand?
\p
\v 4 But there is forgiuenesse with thee: that thou mayest be feared.
\p
\v 5 I wait for the Lord, my soule doeth waite: and in his worde doe I hope.
\p
\v 6 My soule waiteth for the Lord, more then they that watch for the morning: I say, more then they that watch for the morning.
\p
\v 7 Let Israel hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy: and with him is plenteous redemption.
\p
\v 8 And hee shall redeeme Israel, from all his iniquities.

\c 131
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees of Dauid. Lord, my heart is not haughtie, nor mine eyes loftie: neither doe I exercise my selfe in great matters, or in things too high for mee.
\p
\v 2 Surely I haue behaued and quieted my selfe as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soule is euen as a weaned childe.
\p
\v 3 Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth and for euer.

\c 132
\p
\v 1 A Song of degrees. Lord remember Dauid, and all his afflictions:
\p
\v 2 How he sware vnto the Lord, and vowed vnto the mightie God of Iacob.
\p
\v 3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house: nor goe vp into my bed.
\p
\v 4 I will not giue sleepe to mine eyes: or slumber to mine eyelids,
\p
\v 5 Untill I finde out a place for the Lord: an habitation for the mightie God of Iacob.
\p
\v 6 Loe, wee heard of it at Ephrata: we found it in the fields of the wood.
\p
\v 7 We will goe into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstoole.
\p
\v 8 Arise, O Lord, into thy rest: thou, and the Arke of thy strength.
\p
\v 9 Let thy Priestes be clothed with righteousnesse: and let thy saints shout for ioy.
\p
\v 10 For thy seruant Dauids sake: turne not away the face of thine Anointed.
\p
\v 11 The Lord hath sworne in trueth vnto Dauid, hee will not turne from it; of the fruit of thy body will I set vpon thy throne.
\p
\v 12 If thy children will keepe my couenant and my testimonie, that I shall teach them; their children also shall sit vpon thy throne for euermore.
\p
\v 13 For the Lord hath chosen Zion: he hath desired it for his habitation.
\p
\v 14 This is my rest for euer: here will I dwell, for I haue desired it.
\p
\v 15 I will abundantly blesse her prouision: I will satisfie her poore with bread.
\p
\v 16 I will also clothe her priests with saluation: and her Saints shall shout aloud for ioy.
\p
\v 17 There will I make the horne of Dauid to budde: I haue ordained a lampe for mine Anointed.
\p
\v 18 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but vpon himselfe shall his crowne flourish.

\c 133
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees of Dauid. Behold how good and how pleasant it is: for brethren to dwell together in vnitie.
\p
\v 2 It is like the precious oyntment vpon the head, that ranne downe vpon the beard, euen Aarons beard: that went downe to the skirts of his garments.
\p

\c 134
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. Beholde, blesse yee the Lord, all yee seruants of the Lord: which by night stand in the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 2 Lift vp your hands in the Sanctuary: & blesse the Lord.
\p
\v 3 The Lord that made heauen and earth: blesse thee out of Zion.

\c 135
\p
\v 1 Praise ye the Lord, Praise ye the Name of the Lord: prayse him, O ye seruants of the Lord.
\p
\v 2 Yee that stand in the House of the Lord: in the courts of the house of our God.
\p
\v 3 Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good: sing praises vnto his Name, for it is pleasant.
\p
\v 4 For the Lord hath chosen Iacob vnto himselfe: and Israel for his peculiar treasure.
\p
\v 5 For I know that the Lord is great: and that our Lord is aboue all gods.
\p
\v 6 Whatsoeuer the Lord pleased, that did he in heauen and in earth: in the Seas, and all deepe places.
\p
\v 7 Hee causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth, he maketh lightnings for the raine: he bringeth the winde out of his treasuries.
\p
\v 8 Who smote the first borne of Egypt: both of man and beast.
\p
\v 9 Who sent tokens and woonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt: vpon Pharaoh, and vpon all his seruants.
\p
\v 10 Who smote great nations: and slew mightie kings:
\p
\v 11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan: and all the kingdomes of Canaan,
\p
\v 12 And gaue their land for an heritage: an heritage vnto Israel his people.
\p
\v 13 Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for euer: and thy memoriall, O Lord, throughout all generations.
\p
\v 14 For the Lord will iudge his people: and he will repent himselfe concerning his seruants.
\p
\v 15 The idoles of the heathen are siluer and golde: the worke of mens hands.
\p

\p
\v 1 By the riuers of Babylon, there wee sate downe, yea we wept: when we remembred Zion.
\p
\v 2 Wee hanged our harpes vpon the willowes, in the midst thereof.
\p
\v 3 For there they that carried vs away captiue, required of vs a song, and they that wasted vs, required of vs mirth: saying, Sing vs one of the songs of Zion.
\p
\v 4 How shall we sing the Lords song: in a strange land?
\p
\v 5 If I forget thee, O Ierusalem: let my right hand forget her cunning.
\p
\v 6 If I doe not remember thee, let my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth; if I preferre not Ierusalem aboue my chiefe ioy.
\p
\v 7 Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom, in the day of Ierusalem; who sayd, rase it, rase it: euen to the foundation thereof.
\p
\v 8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed: happy shall he be that rewardeth thee, as thou hast serued vs.
\p
\v 9 Happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.

\c 138
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise vnto thee.
\p
\v 2 I will worship towards thy holy temple, and praise thy name, for thy louing kindnesse and for thy trueth: for thou hast magnified thy word aboue all thy name.
\p
\v 3 In the day when I cried, thou answeredst me: and strengthenedst me with strength in my soule.
\p
\v 4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: when they heare the words of thy mouth.
\p
\v 5 Yea they shall sing in the wayes of the Lord: for great is the glory of the Lord.
\p
\v 6 Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect vnto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afarre off.
\p
\v 7 Though I walke in the mids of trouble, thou wilt reuiue me, thou shalt stretch foorth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies: and thy right hand shall saue me.
\p
\v 8 The Lord wil perfit that which concerneth me: thy mercie, O Lord, endureth for euer: forsake not the works of thine owne hands.

\c 139
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician, A Psalme of Dauid. O Lord, thou hast searched mee, and knowen me.
\p
\v 2 Thou knowest my downe sitting, and mine vprising: thou vnderstandest my thought afarre off.
\p
\v 3 Thou compassest my path, and my lying downe, and art acquainted with all my wayes.
\p
\v 4 For there is not a worde in my tongue: but lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether.
\p
\v 5 Thou hast beset me behind, and before: and laid thine hand vpon me.
\p
\v 6 Such knowledge is too wonderfull for me: it is high, I cannot attaine vnto it.
\p
\v 7 Whither shall I goe from thy spirit? or whither shall I flie from thy presence?
\p
\v 8 If I ascend vp into heauen, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
\p
\v 9 If I take the wings of the morning: and dwell in the vttermost parts of the Sea:
\p
\v 10 Euen there shall thy hand leade me: and thy right hand shall hold me.
\p
\v 11 If I say, Surely the darkenes shall couer me: euen the night shall bee light about me.
\p
\v 12 Yea the darkenesse hideth not from thee, but the night shineth as the day: the darknes and the light are both alike to thee.
\p
\v 13 For thou hast possessed my reines: thou hast couered me in my mothers wombe.
\p
\v 14 I will praise thee, for I am fearefully and wonderfully made, marueilous are thy works: and that my soule knoweth right well.
\p
\v 15 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret: and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
\p
\v 16 Thine eyes did see my substance yet being vnperfect, and in thy booke all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned: when as yet there was none of them.
\p
\v 17 Howe precious also are thy thoughts vnto me, O God: how great is the summe of them?
\p
\v 18 If I should count them, they are moe in number then the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.
\p
\v 19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.
\p
\v 20 For they speake against thee wickedly: and thine enemies take thy name in vaine.
\p
\v 21 Doe not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieued with those that rise vp against thee?
\p
\v 22 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
\p
\v 23 Search me, O God, and knowe my heart: trie mee, and knowe my thoughts:
\p
\v 24 And see if there bee any wicked way in me: and leade me in the way euerlasting.

\c 140
\p
\v 1 To the chiefe Musician, A Psalme of Dauid. Deliuer me, O Lord, from the euill man: preserue me from the violent man.
\p
\v 2 Which imagine mischiefes in their heart: continually are they gathered together for warre.
\p
\v 3 They haue sharpned their tongues like a serpent: adders poison is vnder their lips. Selah.
\p
\v 4 Keepe me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked, preserue me from the violent man: who haue purposed to ouerthrow my goings.
\p
\v 5 The proude haue hid a snare for me and cords, they haue spread a net by the way side: they haue set grinnes for me. Selah.
\p
\v 6 I said vnto the Lord, Thou art my God: heare the voyce of my supplications, O Lord.
\p
\v 7 O God the Lord, the strength of my saluation: thou hast couered my head in the day of battell.
\p
\v 8 Grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked deuice, lest they exalt themselues. Selah.
\p
\v 9 As for the head of those that compasse me about: let the mischiefe of their owne lips couer them.
\p
\v 10 Let burning coales fall vpon them, let them be cast into the fire: into deepe pits, that they rise not vp againe.
\p
\v 11 Let not an euill speaker bee established in the earth: euill shall hunt the violent man to ouerthrow him.
\p
\v 12 I know that the Lord will maintaine the cause of the afflicted: and the right of the poore.
\p
\v 13 Surely the righteous shall giue thankes vnto thy Name: the vpright shall dwell in thy presence.

\c 141
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. Lord, I crie vnto thee, make haste vnto mee: giue eare vnto my voice, when I crie vnto thee.
\p
\v 2 Let my prayer bee set foorth before thee as incense: and the lifting vp of my hands as the Euening sacrifice.
\p
\v 3 Set a watch (O Lord) before my mouth: keepe the doore of my lips.
\p
\v 4 Incline not my heart to any euill thing, to practise wicked workes with men that worke iniquitie: and let mee not eate of their dainties.
\p
\v 5 Let the righteous smite mee, it shalbe a kindnesse: and let him reprooue me, it shalbe an excellent oile, which shall not breake my head: for yet my prayer also shalbe in their calamities.
\p
\v 6 When their Iudges are ouerthrowen in stonie places, they shall heare my words, for they are sweet.
\p
\v 7 Our bones are scattered at the graues mouth: as when one cutteth and cleaueth wood vpon the earth.
\p
\v 8 But mine eyes are vnto thee, O God the Lord: in thee is my trust, leaue not my soule destitute.
\p
\v 9 Keepe mee from the snare which they haue laide for me, and the grinnes of the workers of iniquitie.
\p
\v 10 Let the wicked fall into their owne nets: whilest that I withal escape.

\c 142
\p
\v 1 Maschil of Dauid; A prayer when he was in the caue. I cried vnto the Lord with my voice: with my voice vnto the Lord did I make my supplication.
\p
\v 2 I powred out my complaint before him: I shewed before him my trouble.
\p
\v 3 When my spirit was ouerwhelmed within mee, then thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I walked, haue they priuily laid a snare for me.
\p
\v 4 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me, refuge failed me: no man cared for my soule.
\p
\v 5 I cried vnto thee, O Lord, I said, Thou art my refuge, and my portion in the land of the liuing.
\p
\v 6 Attend vnto my crie, for I am brought very low, deliuer mee from my persecuters: for they are stronger then I.
\p
\v 7 Bring my soule out of prison, that I may praise thy Name: the righteous shall compasse me about: for thou shalt deale bountifully with me.

\c 143
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. Heare my prayer, O Lord, giue eare to my supplications: in thy faithfulnesse answere me, and in thy righteousnes.
\p
\v 2 And enter not into iudgement with thy seruant: for in thy sight shall no man liuing be iustified.
\p
\v 3 For the enemie hath persecuted my soule, he hath smitten my life downe to the ground: hee hath made mee to dwell in darkenesse, as those that haue bene long dead.
\p
\v 4 Therefore is my spirit ouerwhelmed within me: my heart within me is desolate.
\p
\v 5 I remember the dayes of old, I meditate on all thy workes: I muse on the worke of thy hands.
\p
\v 6 I stretch forth my hands vnto thee: my soule thirsteth after thee, as a thirstie land, Selah.
\p
\v 7 Heare me speedily, O Lord, my spirit faileth, hide not thy face from mee: lest I be like vnto them that goe downe into the pit.
\p
\v 8 Cause mee to heare thy louing kindnesse in the morning, for in thee doe I trust, cause mee to knowe the way wherein I should walke: for I lift vp my soule vnto thee.
\p
\v 9 Deliuer mee, O Lord, from mine enemies: I flie vnto thee to hide me.
\p
\v 10 Teach me to doe thy will, for thou art my God, thy spirit is good: leade me into the land of vprightnesse.
\p
\v 11 Quicken me, O Lord, for thy names sake: for thy righteousnesse sake bring my soule out of trouble.
\p
\v 12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soule: for I am thy seruant.

\c 144
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teacheth my hands to warre, and my fingers to fight.
\p
\v 2 My goodnes and my fortresse, my high tower and my deliuerer, my shield, and he in whome I trust: who subdueth my people vnder me.
\p
\v 3 Lord, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? or the sonne of man, that thou makest account of him?
\p
\v 4 Man is like to vanity: his dayes are as a shadow that passeth away.
\p
\v 5 Bow thy heauens, O Lord, and come downe: touch the mountaines, and they shall smoke.
\p
\v 6 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoote out thine arrowes, and destroy them.
\p
\v 7 Send thine hand from aboue, rid me, and deliuer me out of great waters: from the hand of strange children,
\p
\v 8 Whose mouth speaketh vanitie: and their right hand is a right hand of falshood.
\p
\v 9 I will sing a new song vnto thee, O God: vpon a psalterie, and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises vnto thee.
\p
\v 10 It is he that giueth saluation vnto kings: who deliuereth Dauid his seruant from the hurtfull sword.
\p
\v 11 Rid me, and deliuer me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanitie: and their right hand is a right hand of falshood.
\p
\v 12 That our sonnes may be as plants growen vp in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:
\p
\v 13 That our garners may bee full, affoording all maner of store; that our sheepe may bring forth thousands, and tenne thousands in our streetes.
\p
\v 14 That our oxen may be strong to labour, that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streetes.
\p
\v 15 Happy is that people that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the Lord.

\v 2 Euery day wil I blesse thee: and I will praise thy Name for euer and euer.
\p
\v 3 Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised: and his greatnes is vnsearchable.
\p
\v 4 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shal declare thy mightie actes.
\p
\v 5 I will speake of the glorious honour of thy maiestie: and of thy wonderous workes.
\p
\v 6 And men shall speake of the might of thy terrible acts: and I wil declare thy greatnesse.
\p
\v 7 They shall abundantly vtter the memory of thy great goodnesse: and shall sing of thy righteousnesse.
\p
\v 8 The Lord is gracious and full of compassion: slow to anger, and of great mercy.
\p
\v 9 The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are ouer all his workes.
\p
\v 10 All thy workes shall praise thee, O Lord: and thy Saints shal blesse thee.
\p
\v 11 They shall speake of the glory of thy kingdome: and talke of thy power.
\p
\v 12 To make knowen to the sonnes of men his mightie actes: and the glorious Maiestie of his kingdome.
\p
\v 13 Thy kingdome is an euerlasting kingdome: and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
\p
\v 14 The Lord vpholdeth all that fall: and raiseth vp all those that bee bowed downe.
\p
\v 15 The eyes of all waite vpon thee: and thou giuest them their meat in due season.
\p
\v 16 Thou openest thine hand: and satisfiest the desire of euery liuing thing.
\p
\v 17 The Lord is righteous in all his wayes: and holy in all his works.
\p
\v 18 The Lord is nigh vnto all them that call vpon him: to all that call vpon him in trueth.
\p
\v 19 Hee will fulfill the desire of them that feare him: he also will heare their cry, and will saue them.
\p
\v 20 The Lord preserueth all them that loue him: but all the wicked will he destroy.
\p
\v 21 My mouth shall speake the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh blesse his holy Name for euer and euer.

\p
\v 1 Praise yee the Lord: prayse the Lord, O my soule.
\p
\v 2 While I liue, will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises vnto my God, while I haue any being.
\p
\v 3 Put not your trust in Princes: nor in the sonne of man, in whom there is no helpe.
\p
\v 4 His breath goeth foorth, he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts perish.
\p
\v 5 Happy is he that hath the God of Iacob for his helpe: whose hope is in the Lord his God:
\p
\v 6 Which made heauen and earth, the Sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth trueth for euer:
\p
\v 7 Which executeth iudgement for the oppressed, which giueth food to the hungry: the Lord looseth the prisoners.
\p
\v 8 The Lord openeth the eyes of the blinde, the Lord raiseth them that are bowed downe: the Lord loueth the righteous.
\p
\v 9 The Lord preserueth the strangers, he relieueth the fatherlesse and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth vpside downe.
\p
\v 10 The Lord shall reigne for euer, euen thy God, O Zion, vnto all generations: Praise ye the Lord.

\p
\v 3 Hee healeth the broken in heart: and bindeth vp their wounds.
\p
\v 4 He telleth the number of the stars: he calleth them all by their names.
\p
\v 5 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his vnderstanding is infinite.
\p
\v 6 The Lord lifteth vp the meeke: hee casteth the wicked downe to the ground.
\p
\v 7 Sing vnto the Lord with thankesgiuing: sing prayse vpon the harpe vnto our God:
\p
\v 8 Who couereth the heauen with cloudes, who prepareth raine for the earth: who maketh grasse to growe vpon the mountaines.
\p
\v 9 He giueth to the beast his foode: and to the yong rauens which crie.
\p
\v 10 Hee delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.
\p
\v 11 The Lord taketh pleasure in them that feare him: in those that hope in his mercie.
\p
\v 12 Praise the Lord, O Ierusalem: praise thy God, O Zion.
\p
\v 13 For hee hath strengthened the barres of thy gates: hee hath blessed thy children within thee.
\p
\v 14 He maketh peace in thy borders: and filleth thee with the finest of the wheate.
\p
\v 15 He sendeth forth his commandement vpon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.
\p
\v 16 He giueth snow like wooll: he scattereth the hoare frost like ashes.
\p
\v 17 He casteth forth his yce like morsels: who can stand before his cold?
\p
\v 18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
\p
\v 19 He sheweth his word vnto Iacob: his statutes and his iudgements vnto Israel.
\p
\v 20 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his iudgements, they haue not knowen them. Praise yee the Lord.
