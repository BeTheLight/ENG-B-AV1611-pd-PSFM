\c 1
\p
\v 1 And these are the wordes of the booke, which Baruch the sonne of Nerias, the sonne of Maasias, the sonne of Sedecias, the sonne of Asadias, the son of Chelcias, wrote in Babylon,
\p
\v 2 In the fift yere, and in the seuenth day of the moneth, what time as the Caldeans tooke Ierusalem, and burnt it with fire.
\p
\v 3 And Baruch did reade the words of this booke, in the hearing of Iechonias, the sonne of Ioachim king of Iuda, and in the eares of all the people, that came to heare the booke.
\p
\v 4 And in the hearing of the nobles, and of the kings sonnes, and in the hearing of the Elders, and of all the people from the lowest vnto the highest, euen of all them that dwelt at Babylon, by the riuer Sud.
\p
\v 5 Whereupon they wept, fasted, and prayed before the Lord.
\p
\v 6 They made also a collection of money, according to euery mans power.
\p
\v 7 And they sent it to Ierusalem vnto Ioachim the hie Priest the sonne of Chelcias, sonne of Salom, and to the Priestes, and to all the people which were found with him at Ierusalem,
\p
\v 8 At the same time, when he receiued the vessels of the house of the Lord that were caried out of the Temple, to returne them into the land of Iuda the tenth day of the moneth Siuan, namely siluer vessels, which Sedecias the sonne of Iosias king of Iuda had made,
\p
\v 9 After that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had caried away Iechonias, and the Princes, and the captiues, and the mightie men, and the people of the land from Ierusalem, and brought them vnto Babylon:
\p
\v 10 And they said, Behold, we haue sent you money, to buy you burnt offerings, and sinne offerings, and incense, and prepare yee Manna, and offer vpon the Altar of the Lord our God,
\p
\v 11 And pray for the life of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and for the life of Balthasar his sonne, that their dayes may be vpon earth as the dayes of heauen.
\p
\v 12 And the Lord wil giue vs strength, and lighten our eyes, and we shall liue vnder the shadow of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and vnder the shadow of Balthasar his sonne, and wee shall serue them many dayes, and finde fauour in their sight.
\p
\v 13 Pray for vs also vnto the Lord our God, (for wee haue sinned against the Lord our God, and vnto this day the fury of the Lord, and his wrath is not turned from vs)
\p
\v 14 And yee shall reade this booke, which we haue sent vnto you, to make confession in the house of the Lord, vpon the feasts and solemne dayes.
\p
\v 15 And yee shall say, To the Lord our God belongeth righteousnesse, but vnto vs the confusion of faces, as it is come to passe this day vnto them of Iuda, & to the inhabitants of Ierusalem,
\p
\v 16 And to our kings, and to our princes, and to our Priests, and to our Prophets, and to our fathers.
\p
\v 17 For wee haue sinned before the Lord,
\p
\v 18 And disobeyed him, and haue not hearkened vnto the voice of the Lord our God, to walke in the commaundements that he gaue vs openly:
\p
\v 19 Since the day that the Lorde brought our forefathers out of the land of Egypt, vnto this present day, wee haue beene disobedient vnto the Lord our God, and we haue beene negligent in not hearing his voice.
\p
\v 20 Wherefore the euils cleaued vnto vs, and the curse which the Lord appointed by Moses his seruant, at the time that he brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, to giue vs a land that floweth with milke and honie, like as it is to see this day.
\p
\v 21 Neuerthelesse we haue not hearkened vnto the voice of the Lord our God, according vnto all the wordes of the Prophets, whom he sent vnto vs.
\p
\v 22 But euery man followed the imagination of his owne wicked heart, to serue strange gods, and to doe euill in the sight of the Lord our God.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 Therefore the Lord hath made good his worde, which hee pronounced against vs, and against our Iudges that iudged Israel, and against our kings, and against our princes, and against the men of Israel and Iuda,
\p
\v 2 To bring vpon vs great plagues, such as neuer happened vnder the whole heauen, as it came to passe in Ierusalem, according to the things that were written in the Law of Moses,
\p
\v 3 That a man should eat the flesh of his owne sonne, and the flesh of his owne daughter.
\p
\v 4 Moreouer, he hath deliuered them to be in subiection to all the kingdomes that are round about vs, to be as a reproch and desolation among all the people round about, where the Lord hath scattered them.
\p
\v 5 Thus wee were cast downe and not exalted, because wee haue sinned against the Lord our God, and haue not beene obedient vnto his voice.
\p
\v 6 To the Lord our God appertaineth righteousnesse: but vnto vs and to our fathers open shame, as appeareth this day.
\p
\v 7 For all these plagues are come vpon vs, which the Lord hath pronounced against vs,
\p
\v 8 Yet haue we not prayed before the Lord, &thorn;t we might turne euery one from the imaginations of his wicked heart.
\p
\v 9 Wherefore the Lord watched ouer vs for euill, and the Lord hath brought it vpon vs: for the Lord is righteous in all his works, which he hath commanded vs.
\p
\v 10 Yet we haue not hearkened vnto his voice, to walk in the c&#333;mandements of the Lord, that he hath set before vs.
\p
\v 11 And now O Lord God of Israel, that hast brought thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and high arme, and with signes & with wonders, & with great power, and hast gotten thy selfe a name, as appeareth this day:
\p
\v 12 O Lord our God, we haue sinned, we haue done vngodly, wee haue dealt vnrighteously in all thine ordinances.
\p
\v 13 Let thy wrath turne from vs: for we are but a few left among the heathen, where thou hast scattered vs.
\p
\v 14 Heare our prayers, O Lord, and our petitions, and deliuer vs for thine owne sake, and giue vs fauour in the sight of them which haue led vs away:
\p
\v 15 That all the earth may know that thou art &thorn;e Lord our God, because Israel & his posterity is called by thy name.
\p
\v 16 O Lord looke downe from thy holy house, & consider vs: bow downe thine eare, O Lord, to heare vs.
\p
\v 17 Open thine eyes and behold: for the dead that are in the graues, whose soules are taken from their bodies, wil giue vnto the Lord neither praise nor righteousnesse.
\p
\v 18 But &thorn;e soule that is greatly vexed, which goeth stouping & feeble, and the eyes that faile, and the hungry soule wil giue thee praise & righteousnes O Lord.
\p
\v 19 Therfore wee doe not make our humble supplication before thee, O Lord our God, for the righteousnes of our fathers, and of our kings.
\p
\v 20 For thou hast sent out thy wrath & indignation vpon vs, as thou hast spoken by thy seruants &thorn;e prophets, saying,
\p
\v 21 Thus saith the Lord, bow down your shoulders to serue the king of Babylon: so shall ye remaine in the lande that I gaue vnto your fathers.
\p
\v 22 But if ye will not heare the voice of the Lord to serue &thorn;e king of Babylon,
\p
\v 23 I will cause to cease out of the cities of Iuda, and from without Ierusalem the voice of mirth, and the voice of ioy: the voice of the bridegrome, and the voice of the bride, and the whole land shall be desolate of inhabitants.
\p
\v 24 But we would not hearken vnto thy voyce, to serue the king of Babylon: therefore hast thou made good the wordes that thou spakest by thy seruants the prophets, namely that the bones of our kings, and the bones of our fathers should be taken out of their places.
\p
\v 25 And loe, they are cast out to the heat of the day, and to the frost of the night, and they died in great miseries, by famine, by sword, and by pestilence.
\p
\v 26 And the house which is called by thy name (hast thou laid waste) as it is to be seene this day, for the wickednesse of the house of Israel, and the house of Iuda.
\p
\v 27 O Lord our God, thou hast dealt with vs after all thy goodnesse, and according to all that great mercie of thine.
\p
\v 28 As thou spakest by thy seruant Moses in the day when thou didst command him to write thy Law, before the children of Israel, saying,
\p
\v 29 If ye will not heare my voyce, surely this very great multitude shalbe turned into a smal number among the nations, where I will scatter them.
\p
\v 30 For I knew that they would not heare me: because it is a stiffenecked people: but in the land of their captiuities, they shall remember themselues,
\p
\v 31 And shall know that I am the Lord their God: For I giue them an heart, and eares to heare.
\p
\v 32 And they shal praise me in the land of their captiuitie, and thinke vpon my name,
\p
\v 33 And returne from their stiffe neck, and from their wicked deeds: for they shal remember the way of their fathers which sinned before the Lord.
\p
\v 34 And I will bring them againe into the land which I promised with an oath vnto their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, and they shall bee lords of it, and I will increase them, and they shall not be diminished.
\p
\v 35 And I will make an euerlasting couenant with them, to be their God, and they shall be my people: and I will no more driue my people of Israel out of the land that I haue giuen them.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 O Lord almighty, God of Israel, the soule in anguish, the troubled spirit crieth vnto thee.
\p
\v 2 Heare O Lord, and haue mercy: for thou art mercifull, and haue pitty vpon vs, because we haue sinned before thee.
\p
\v 3 For thou endurest for euer, and we perish vtterly.
\p
\v 4 O Lord almighty, thou God of Israel, heare now the prayers of the dead Israelites, and of their children, which haue sinned before thee, and not hearkened vnto the voice of thee their God: for the which cause these plagues cleaue vnto vs.
\p
\v 5 Remember not the iniquities of our forefathers: but thinke vpon thy power and thy name, now at this time.
\p
\v 6 For thou art the Lord our God, and thee, O Lord, will we praise.
\p
\v 7 And for this cause thou hast put thy feare in our hearts, to the intent that we should call vpon thy name, and praise thee in our captiuity: for we haue called to minde all the iniquity of our forefathers that sinned before thee.
\p
\v 8 Behold, we are yet this day in our captiuity, where thou hast scattered vs, for a reproch and a curse, and to be subiect to payments, according to all the iniquities of our fathers which departed from the Lord our God.
\p
\v 9 Heare, Israel, the commandements of life, giue eare to vnderstand wisedome.
\p
\v 10 How happeneth it, Israel, that thou art in thine enemies land, that thou art waxen old in a strange countrey, that thou art defiled with the dead?
\p
\v 11 That thou art counted with them that goe downe into the graue?
\p
\v 12 Thou hast forsaken the fountaine of wisedome.
\p
\v 13 For if thou hadst walked in the way of God, thou shouldest haue dwelled in peace for euer.
\p
\v 14 Learne where is wisedome, where is strength, where is vnderstanding, that thou mayest know also where is length of daies, and life, where is the light of the eyes and peace.
\p
\v 15 Who hath found out her place? or who hath come into her treasures?
\p
\v 16 Where are the princes of the heathen become, and such as ruled the beasts vpon the earth.
\p
\v 17 They that had their pastime with the foules of the aire, and they that hoorded vp siluer and gold wherein men trust, and made no end of their getting?
\p
\v 18 For they that wrought in siluer, and were so carefull, and whose workes are vnsearchable,
\p
\v 19 They are vanished, and gone downe to the graue, and others are come vp in their steads.
\p
\v 20 Young men haue seene light, and dwelt vpon the earth: but the way of knowledge haue they not knowen,
\p
\v 21 Nor vnderstood the pathes thereof; nor laid hold of it: their children were farre off from that way.
\p
\v 22 It hath not beene heard of in Chanaan: neither hath it beene seene in Theman.
\p
\v 23 The Agarenes that seek wisdome vpon earth, the marchants of Merran, and of Theman, the authors of fables, and searchers out of vnderstanding: none of these haue knowen the way of wisedome, or remember her pathes.
\p
\v 24 O Israel, how great is the house of God? and how large is the place of his possession?
\p
\v 25 Great, and hath none end: high, and vnmeasurable.
\p
\v 26 There were the gyants, famous from the beginning, that were of so great stature, and so expert in warre.
\p
\v 27 Those did not the Lord chuse, neither gaue he the way of knowledge vnto them.
\p
\v 28 But they were destroyed, because they had no wisedome, and perished through their owne foolishnesse.
\p
\v 29 Who hath gone vp into heauen and taken her, and brought her downe from the clouds?
\p
\v 30 Who hath gone ouer the Sea, and found her, & wil bring her for pure gold?
\p
\v 31 No man knoweth her way, nor thinketh of her path.
\p
\v 32 But he that knoweth all things, knoweth her, and hath found her out with his vnderstanding: he that prepared the earth for euermore, hath filled it with fourefooted beasts.
\p
\v 33 He that sendeth forth light, and it goeth: calleth it againe, and it obeyeth him with feare.
\p
\v 34 The starres shined in their watches, and reioyced: when he calleth them, they say, Here we be, and so with cheerefulnesse they shewed light vnto him that made them.
\p
\v 35 This is our God, and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison of him.
\p
\v 36 He hath found out all the way of knowledge, and hath giuen it vnto Iacob his seruant, & to Israel his beloued.
\p
\v 37 Afterward did he shew himselfe vpon earth, and conuersed with men.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 This is the Booke of the commandements of God: and the Law that endureth for euer: all they that keepe it shall come to life: but such as leaue it, shall die.
\p
\v 2 Turne thee, O Iacob, & take heed of it: walke in the presence of the light therof, that thou mayest be illuminated.
\p
\v 3 Giue not thine honour to another, nor the things that are profitable vnto thee, to a strange nation.
\p
\v 4 O Israel, happie are wee: for things that are pleasing to God, are made knowen vnto vs.
\p
\v 5 Be of good cheare, my people, the memoriall of Israel.
\p
\v 6 Ye were sold to the nations, not for your destruction: but because you moued God to wrath, ye were deliuered vnto the enemies.
\p
\v 7 For yee prouoked him that made you, by sacrificing vnto deuils, and not to God.
\p
\v 8 Ye haue forgotten the euerlasting God, that brought you vp, and ye haue grieued Ierusalem that noursed you.
\p
\v 9 For when shee saw the wrath of God c&#333;ming vpon you, she said; Hearken, O ye that dwell about Sion: God hath brought vp&#333; me great mourning.
\p
\v 10 For I saw the captiuitie of my sonnes and daughters, which the euerlasting brought vpon them.
\p
\v 11 With ioy did I nourish them: but sent them away with weeping and mourning.
\p
\v 12 Let no man reioyce ouer me a widow, and forsaken of many, who for the sinnes of my children, am left desolate: because they departed from the Law of God.
\p
\v 13 They knew not his statutes, nor walked in the waies of his Commandements, nor trode in the pathes of discipline in his righteousnesse.
\p
\v 14 Let them that dwell about Sion come, and remember ye the captiuity of my sonnes and daughters, which the euerlasting hath brought vpon them.
\p
\v 15 For he hath brought a nation vpon them from far: a shamelesse nation, and of a strange language, who neither reuerenced old man, nor pitied childe.
\p
\v 16 These haue caried away the deare beloued children of the widow, and left her that was alone, desolate without daughters.
\p
\v 17 But what can I helpe you?
\p
\v 18 For he that brought these plagues vpon you, will deliuer you from the hands of your enemies.
\p
\v 19 Goe your way, O my children, goe your way: for I am left desolate.
\p
\v 20 I haue put off the clothing of peace, and put vpon me the sackcloth of my prayer. I will cry vnto the euerlasting in my dayes.
\p
\v 21 Be of good cheare, O my children, cry vnto the Lord: & he shal deliuer you from the power & hand of the enemies.
\p
\v 22 For my hope is in the Euerlasting that hee will saue you, and ioy is come vnto me from the Holy one, because of the mercy which shall soone come vnto you from the euerlasting our Sauiour.
\p
\v 23 For I sent you out with mourning and weeping: but God will giue you to mee againe, with ioy and gladnesse for euer.
\p
\v 24 Like as now the neighbours of Sion haue seene your captiuity: so shall they see shortly your saluation from our God, which shall come vpon you with great glory, and brightnesse of the euerlasting.
\p
\v 25 My children, suffer patiently the wrath that is come vpon you from God: for thine enemy hath persecuted thee: but shortly thou shalt see his destruction, & shalt tread vpon his necke.
\p
\v 26 My delicate ones haue gone rough wayes, and were taken away as a flocke caught of the enemies.
\p
\v 27 Be of good comfort, O my children, and cry vnto God: for you shall be remembred of him that brought these things vpon you.
\p
\v 28 For as it was your minde to goe astray from God: so being returned seeke him ten times more.
\p
\v 29 For he that hath brought these plagues vpon you, shall bring you euerlasting ioy againe with your saluation.
\p
\v 30 Take a good heart, O Ierusalem: for hee that gaue thee that name, will comfort thee.
\p
\v 31 Miserable are they that afflicted thee, and reioyced at thy fall.
\p
\v 32 Miserable are the cities which thy children serued: miserable is she that receiued thy sonnes.
\p
\v 33 For as shee reioyced at thy ruine, and was glad of thy fall: so shall she be grieued for her owne desolation.
\p
\v 34 For I will take away the reioycing of her great multitude, and her pride shalbe turned into mourning.
\p
\v 35 For fire shal come vpon her fr&#333; the euerlasting, long to endure: and she shal be inhabited of deuils for a great time.
\p
\v 36 O Ierusalem, looke about thee toward the East, and behold the ioy that commeth vnto thee from God.
\p
\v 37 Loe, thy sonnes come whom thou sentest away: they come gathered together from the East to the West, by the word of the holy One, reioycing in the glory of God.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 Put off, O Ierusalem, the garment of thy mourning and affliction, and put on the comelinesse of the glory that commeth from God for euer.
\p
\v 2 Cast about thee a double garment of the righteousnesse which commeth from God, and set a diademe on thine head of the glory of the euerlasting.
\p
\v 3 For God wil shew thy brightnesse vnto euery countrey vnder heauen.
\p
\v 4 For thy name shall bee called of God for euer, The peace of righteousnesse, and the glory of Gods worship.
\p
\v 5 Arise, O Ierusalem, and stand on high, and looke about toward the East, and behold thy children gathered from the West vnto the East by the word of the holy One, reioycing in the remembrance of God.
\p
\v 6 For they departed from thee on foote, and were ledde away of their enemies: but God bringeth them vnto thee exalted with glory, as children of the kingdome.
\p
\v 7 For God hath appointed that euery high hill, and banks of long continuance should be cast downe, and valleys filled vp, to make euen the ground, that Israel may goe safely in the glory of God.
\p
\v 8 Moreouer, euen the woods, & euery sweet smelling tree, shall ouershadow Israel by the commandement of God.
\p
\v 9 For God shall leade Israel with ioy, in the light of his glory, with the mercy and righteousnes that commeth from him.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 In stead of a friend, become not an enemie; for thereby thou shalt inherite an ill name, shame, and reproch: euen so shall a sinner that hath a double tongue.
\p
\v 2 Extoll not thy selfe in the counsell of thine owne heart, that thy soule bee not torne in pieces as a bull straying alone.
\p
\v 3 Thou shalt eat vp thy leaues, and loose thy fruit, and leaue thy selfe as a dry tree.
\p
\v 4 A wicked soule shall destroy him that hath it, and shall make him to be laughed to scorne of his enemies.
\p
\v 5 Sweet language will multiply friends: and a faire speaking tongue will increase kinde greetings.
\p
\v 6 Be in peace with many: neuerthelesse haue but one counseller of a thousand.
\p
\v 7 If thou wouldst get a friend, proue him first, and be not hasty to credit him.
\p
\v 8 For some man is a friend for his owne occasion, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble.
\p
\v 9 And there is a friend, who being turned to enmitie, and strife, will discouer thy reproch.
\p
\v 10 Againe some friend is a companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of thy affliction.
\p
\v 11 But in thy prosperitie hee will be as thy selfe, and will be bould ouer thy seruants.
\p
\v 12 If thou be brought low, he will be against thee, and will hide himselfe from thy face.
\p
\v 13 Separate thy selfe from thine enemies, and take heed of thy friends.
\p
\v 14 A faithfull friend is a strong defence: and hee that hath found such an one, hath found a treasure.
\p
\v 15 Nothing doeth counteruaile a faithful friend, and his excellencie is vnualuable.
\p
\v 16 A faithfull friend is the medicine of life, and they that feare the Lord shal finde him.
\p
\v 17 Who so feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship aright, for as he is, so shall his neighbour be also.
\p
\v 18 My sonne, gather instruction from thy youth vp: so shalt thou finde wisedome till thine old age.
\p
\v 19 Come vnto her as one that ploweth, and soweth, and wait for her good fruits, for thou shalt not toile much in labouring about her, but thou shalt eat of her fruits right soone.
\p
\v 20 She is very vnpleasant to the vnlearned: he that is without vnderstanding, will not remaine with her.
\p
\v 21 She wil lye vpon him as a mightie stone of triall, and hee will cast her from him ere it be long.
\p
\v 22 For wisedome is according to her name, and she is not manifest vnto many.
\p
\v 23 Giue eare, my sonne, receiue my aduice, and refuse not my counsell,
\p
\v 24 And put thy feet into her fetters, and thy necke into her chaine.
\p
\v 25 Bow downe thy shoulder, and beare her, and be not grieued with her bonds.
\p
\v 26 Come vnto her with thy whole heart, and keepe her wayes with all thy power.
\p
\v 27 Search and seeke, and shee shall bee made knowen vnto thee, and when thou hast got hold of her, let her not goe.
\p
\v 28 For at the last thou shalt finde her rest, and that shalbe turned to thy ioy.
\p
\v 29 Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and her chaines a robe of glory.
\p
\v 30 For there is a golden ornament vpon her, and her bandes are purple lace.
\p
\v 31 Thou shalt put her on as a robe of honour: and shalt put her about thee as a crowne of ioy.
\p
\v 32 My sonne, if thou wilt, thou shalt bee taught: and if thou wilt apply thy minde, thou shalt be prudent.
\p
\v 33 If thou loue to heare, thou shalt receiue vnderstanding: and if thou bow thine eare, thou shalt be wise.
\p
\v 34 Stand in the multitude of the elders, and cleaue vnto him that is wise.
\p
\v 35 Be willing to heare euery godly discourse, and let not the parables of vnderstanding escape thee.
\p
\v 36 And if thou seest a man of vnderstanding, get thee betimes vnto him, and let thy foote weare the steps of his doore.
\p
\v 37 Let thy minde be vpon the ordinances of the Lord, & meditate continually in his commandements: he shal establish thine heart, and giue thee wisedome at thine owne desire.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 Doe no euill, so shall no harme come vnto thee.
\p
\v 2 Depart from the vniust, and iniquitie shall turne away from thee.
\p
\v 3 My sonne, sow not vpon the furrowes of vnrighteousnesse, and thou shalt not reape them seuen folde.
\p
\v 4 Seeke not of the Lord preheminence, neither of the King the seate of honour.
\p
\v 5 Iustifie not thy selfe before the Lord, and boast not of thy wisedome before the king.
\p
\v 6 Seeke not to be iudge, being not able to take away iniquitie, lest at any time thou feare the person of the mightie, and lay a stumbling blocke in the way of thy vprightnesse.
\p
\v 7 Offend not against the multitude of a city, and then thou shalt not cast thy selfe downe among the people.
\p
\v 8 Bind not one sinne vpon another, for in one thou shalt not be vnpunished.
\p
\v 9 Say not, God wil looke vpon the multitude of my oblations, and when I offer to the most High God, he will accept it.
\p
\v 10 Be not faint hearted when thou makest thy prayer, and neglect not to giue almes.
\p
\v 11 Laugh no man to scorne in the bitternesse of his soule: for there is one which humbleth and exalteth.
\p
\v 12 Deuise not a lie against thy brother: neither doe the like to thy friend.
\p
\v 13 Use not to make any maner of lie: for the custome thereof is not good.
\p
\v 14 Use not many words in a multitude of Elders, and make not much babling when thou prayest.
\p
\v 15 Hate not laborious worke, neither husbandrie, which the most High hath ordeined.
\p
\v 16 Number not thy selfe among the multitude of sinners, but remember that wrath will not tary long.
\p
\v 17 Humble thy soule greatly: for the vengeance of the vngodly is fire and wormes.
\p
\v 18 Change not a friend for any good by no meanes: neither a faithfull brother for the gold of Ophir.
\p
\v 19 Forgoe not a wise and good woman: for her grace is aboue gold.
\p
\v 20 Whereas thy seruant worketh truely, entreate him not euill, nor the hireling that bestoweth himselfe wholly for thee.
\p
\v 21 Let thy soule loue a good seruant, and defraud him not of liberty.
\p
\v 22 Hast thou cattell? haue an eye to them, and if they be for thy profit, keepe them with thee.
\p
\v 23 Hast thou children? instruct them, and bow downe their necke from their youth.
\p
\v 24 Hast thou daughters? haue care of their body, and shewe not thy selfe cheerefull toward them.
\p
\v 25 Marrie thy daughter, and so shalt thou haue performed a weightie matter: but giue her to a man of vnderstanding.
\p
\v 26 Hast thou a wife after thy minde? forsake her not, but giue not thy selfe ouer to a light woman.
\p
\v 27 Honour thy father with thy whole heart, and forget not the sorrowes of thy mother.
\p
\v 28 Remember that thou wast begot of them, and how canst thou recompense them the things that they haue done for thee?
\p
\v 29 Feare the Lord with all thy soule, and reuerence his priests.
\p
\v 30 Loue him that made thee with all thy strength, and forsake not his ministers.
\p
\v 31 Feare the Lord, and honour the priest: and giue him his portion, as it is commanded thee, the first fruits, and the trespasse offering, & the gift of the shoulders, and the sacrifice of sanctification, and the first fruits of the holy things.
\p
\v 32 And stretch thine hand vnto the poore, that thy blessing may be perfected
\p
\v 33 A gift hath grace in the sight of euery man liuing, and for the dead deteine it not.
\p
\v 34 Faile not to bee with them that weepe, and mourne with them that mourne.
\p
\v 35 Be not slow to visit the sicke: for that shall make thee to be beloued.
\p
\v 36 Whatsoeuer thou takest in hand, remember the end, and thou shalt neuer doe amisse.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 Striue not with a mighty man, lest thou fall into his hands.
\p
\v 2 Bee not at variance with a rich man, lest he ouerweigh thee: for gold hath destroyed many, and peruerted the hearts of kings.
\p
\v 3 Striue not with a man that is full of tongue, and heape not wood vpon his fire.
\p
\v 4 Iest not with a rude man, lest thy ancestours be disgraced.
\p
\v 5 Reproch not a man that turneth from sinne, but remember that we are all worthy of punishment.
\p
\v 6 Dishonour not a man in his old age: for euen some of vs waxe old.
\p
\v 7 Reioice not ouer thy greatest enemie being dead, but remember that we die all.
\p
\v 8 Despise not the discourse of the wise, but acquaint thy selfe with their prouerbs; for of them thou shalt learne instruction, & how to serue great men with ease.
\p
\v 9 Misse not the discourse of the Elders: for they also learned of their fathers, and of them thou shalt learne vnderstanding, and to giue answere as need requireth.
\p
\v 10 Kindle not the coales of a sinner, lest thou be burnt with the flame of his fire.
\p
\v 11 Rise not vp (in anger) at the presence of an iniurious person, least he lie in waite to entrap thee in thy words.
\p
\v 12 Lend not vnto him that is mightier then thy selfe; for if thou lendest him, count it but lost.
\p
\v 13 Be not surety aboue thy power: for if thou be surety, take care to pay it.
\p
\v 14 Goe not to law with a iudge, for they will iudge for him according to his honour.
\p
\v 15 Trauaile not by the way with a bold fellow, least he become grieuous vnto thee: for he will doe according to his owne will, and thou shalt perish with him through his folly.
\p
\v 16 Striue not with an angry man, and goe not with him into a solitary place: for blood is as nothing in his sight, and where there is no helpe, he will ouerthrow thee.
\p
\v 17 Consult not with a foole; for he cannot keepe counsell.
\p
\v 18 Doe no secret thing before a stranger, for thou knowest not what he will bring forth.
\p
\v 19 Open not thine heart to euery man, least he requite thee with a shrewd turne.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 Be not iealous ouer the wife of thy bosome, and teach her not an euil lesson against thy selfe.
\p
\v 2 Giue not thy soule vnto a woman, to set her foot vpon thy substance.
\p
\v 3 Meete not with an harlot, least thou fall into her snares.
\p
\v 4 Use not much the companie of a woman that is a singer, least thou be taken with her attempts.
\p
\v 5 Gaze not on a maide, that thou fall not by those things, that are pretious in her.
\p
\v 6 Giue not thy soule vnto harlots, that thou loose not thine inheritance.
\p
\v 7 Looke not round about thee, in the streets of the citie, neither wander thou in the solitary places thereof.
\p
\v 8 Turne away thine eye from a beautifull woman, and looke not vpon anothers beautie: for many haue beene deceiued by the beautie of a woman, for heerewith loue is kindled as a fire.
\p
\v 9 Sit not at all with another mans wife, nor sit downe with her in thine armes, and spend not thy money with her at the wine, least thine heart incline vnto her, and so thorough thy desire thou fall into destruction.
\p
\v 10 Forsake not an old friend, for the new is not comparable to him: a new friend is as new wine: when it is old, thou shalt drinke it with pleasure.
\p
\v 11 Enuy not the glory of a sinner: for thou knowest not what shall be his end.
\p
\v 12 Delight not in the thing that the vngodly haue pleasure in, but remember they shall not goe vnpunished vnto their graue.
\p
\v 13 Keepe thee farre from the man that hath power to kill, so shalt thou not doubt the feare of death: and if thou come vnto him, make no fault, least he take away thy life presently: remember that thou goest in the midst of snares, and that thou walkest vpon the battlements of the citie.
\p
\v 14 As neere as thou canst, ghesse at thy neighbour, and consult with the wise.
\p
\v 15 Let thy talke be with the wise, and all thy communication in the law of the most high.
\p
\v 16 And let iust men eate and drinke with thee, and let thy glorying be in the feare of the Lord.
\p
\v 17 For the hand of the artificer, the worke shall be commended: and the wise ruler of the people, for his speech.
\p
\v 18 A man of an ill tongue is dangerous in his citie, and he that is rash in his talke shall be hated.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 A wise iudge will instruct his people, & the gouernement of a prudent man is well ordered.
\p
\v 2 As the iudge of the people is himselfe, so are his officers, and what maner of man the ruler of the citie is, such are all they that dwell therein.
\p
\v 3 An vnwise king destroyeth his people, but through the prudence of them which are in authoritie, the citie shalbe inhabited.
\p
\v 4 The power of the earth is in the hand of the Lord, and in due time hee will set ouer it one that is profitable.
\p
\v 5 In the hand of God is the prosperitie of man: and vpon the person of the scribe shall he lay his honour.
\p
\v 6 Beare not hatred to thy neighbour for euery wrong, and do nothing at all by iniurious practises.
\p
\v 7 Pride is hatefull before God, and man: and by both doeth one commit iniquitie.
\p
\v 8 Because of vnrighteous dealings, iniuries, and riches got by deceit, the kingdome is translated from one people to another.
\p
\v 9 Why is earth and ashes proude? There is not a more wicked thing, then a couetous man: for such an one setteth his owne soule to sale, because while he liueth, he casteth away his bowels.
\p
\v 10 The Phisition cutteth off a long disease, and he that is to day a King, to morrow shall die.
\p
\v 11 For when a man is dead, hee shall inherite creeping things, beastes and wormes.
\p
\v 12 The beginning of pride is, when one departeth from God, and his heart is turned away from his maker.
\p
\v 13 For pride is the beginning of sinne, and hee that hath it, shall powre out abomination: and therefore the Lord brought vpon them strange calamities, and ouerthrew them vtterly.
\p
\v 14 The Lord hath cast downe the thrones of proud Princes, and set vp the meeke in their stead.
\p
\v 15 The Lord hath plucked vp the rootes of the proud nations: and planted the lowly in their place.
\p
\v 16 The Lord ouerthrew countreys of the heathen: and destroyed them to the foundations of the earth.
\p
\v 17 He tooke some of them away, and destroyed them, and hath made their memoriall to cease from the earth.
\p
\v 18 Pride was not made for men, nor furious anger for them that are borne of a woman.
\p
\v 19 They that feare the Lord are a sure seed, and they that loue him, an honourable plant: they that regard not the Law, are a dishonourable seed, they that transgresse the commandements, are a deceiuable seed.
\p
\v 20 Among brethren he that is chiefe is honourable, so are they that feare the Lord in his eyes.
\p
\v 21 The feare of the Lord goeth before the obtayning of authoritie: but roughnesse and pride, is the loosing thereof.
\p
\v 22 Whether hee bee rich, noble, or poore, their glorie is the feare of the Lord.
\p
\v 23 It is not meet to despise the poore man that hath vnderstanding, neither is it conuenient to magnifie a sinnefull man.
\p
\v 24 Great men, and Iudges, and Potentates shall bee honoured, yet is there none of them greater then he that feareth the Lord.
\p
\v 25 Unto the seruant that is wise, shall they that are free doe seruice: and hee that hath knowledge, will not grudge when he is reformed.
\p
\v 26 Be not ouerwise in doing thy busines, and boast not thy selfe in the time of thy distresse.
\p
\v 27 Better is he that laboureth and aboundeth in all things, then hee that boasteth himselfe, and wanteth bread.
\p
\v 28 My sonne, glorifie thy soule in meekenesse, and giue it honour according to the dignitie thereof.
\p
\v 29 Who wil iustifie him that sinneth against his owne soule? and who will honour him that dishonoureth his owne life?
\p
\v 30 The poore man is honoured for his skill, and the rich man is honoured for his riches.
\p
\v 31 Hee that is honoured in pouertie, how much more in riches? And he that is dishonourable in riches, how much more in pouertie?

\c 11
\p
\v 1 Wisedome lifteth vp the head of him that is of low degree, and maketh him to sit among great men.
\p
\v 2 Commend not a man for his beautie, neither abhorre a man for his outward appearance.
\p
\v 3 The Bee is little among such as flie, but her fruite is the chiefe of sweete things.
\p
\v 4 Boast not of thy cloathing and raiment, and exalt not thy selfe in the day of honour: for the workes of the Lord are wonderfull, and his workes among men are hidden.
\p
\v 5 Many kings haue sit downe vpon the ground, and one that was neuer thought of, hath worne the crowne.
\p
\v 6 Many mightie men haue beene greatly disgraced: and the honourable deliuered into other mens hands.
\p
\v 7 Blame not before thou hast examined the trueth: vnderstand first, and then rebuke.
\p
\v 8 Answere not, before thou hast heard the cause: neither interrupt men in the midst of their talke.
\p
\v 9 Striue not in a matter that concerneth thee not: and sit not in iudgement with sinners.
\p
\v 10 My sonne, meddle not with many matters: for if thou meddle much, thou shalt not be innocent: and if thou follow after, thou shalt not obtaine, neither shalt thou escape by flying.
\p
\v 11 There is one that laboureth and taketh paines, and maketh haste, and is so much the more behinde.
\p
\v 12 Againe, there is another that is slow, and hath neede of helpe, wanting abilitie, and full of pouertie, yet the eye of the Lord looked vpon him for good, and set him vp from his low estate,
\p
\v 13 And lifted vp his head from miserie, so that many that saw it, marueiled at him.
\p
\v 14 Prosperitie and aduersitie, life and death, pouerty and riches, come of the Lord.
\p
\v 15 Wisedome, knowledge, and vnderstanding of the Lawe, are of the Lord: loue, & the way of good workes, are from him.
\p
\v 16 Errour and darkenesse had their beginning together with sinners: and euill shall waxe old with them that glory therein.
\p
\v 17 The gift of the Lord remaineth with the godly, and his fauour bringeth prosperitie for euer.
\p
\v 18 There is that waxeth rich by his warinesse, and pinching, and this is the portion of his reward:
\p
\v 19 Whereas he sayth, I haue found rest, and now will eate continually of my goods, and yet hee knoweth not what time shall come vpon him, and that hee must leaue those things to others, and die.
\p
\v 20 Be stedfast in thy couenant, and be conuersant therein, and waxe olde in thy worke.
\p
\v 21 Marueile not at the workes of sinners, but trust in the Lord, and abide in thy labour: for it is an easie thing in the sight of the Lord, on the sudden to make a poore man rich.
\p
\v 22 The blessing of the Lord is in the reward of the godly, and suddenly he maketh his blessing to flourish.
\p
\v 23 Say not, what profit is there of my seruice? and what good things shal I haue hereafter?
\p
\v 24 Againe, say not, I haue enough, and possesse many things; and what euill can come to me hereafter?
\p
\v 25 In the day of prosperitie, there is a forgetfulnesse of affliction: and in the day of affliction, there is no remembrance of prosperitie.
\p
\v 26 For it is an easie thing vnto the Lord in the day of death, to reward a man according to his wayes.
\p
\v 27 The affliction of an houre, maketh a man forget pleasure: and in his end, his deeds shalbe discouered.
\p
\v 28 Iudge none blessed before his death: for a man shall bee knowen in his children.
\p
\v 29 Bring not euery man into thine house, for the deceitfull man hath many traines.
\p
\v 30 Like as a Partrich taken and kept in a cage, so is the heart of the proud; and like as a spie, watcheth hee for thy fall.
\p
\v 31 For hee lieth in wait, and turneth good into euill, and in things worthy praise, will lay blame vpon thee.
\p
\v 32 Of a sparke of fire, a heape of coales is kindled: and a sinnefull man layeth waite for blood.
\p
\v 33 Take heed of a mischieuous man, (for hee worketh wickednesse) lest hee bring vpon thee a perpetuall blot.
\p
\v 34 Receiue a stranger into thine house, and hee will disturbe thee, and turne thee out of thine owne.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 When thou wilt doe good, know to wh&#333; thou doest it, so shalt thou be thanked for thy benefites.
\p
\v 2 Do good to the godly man, and thou shalt find a recompence, and if not from him, yet from the most high.
\p
\v 3 There can no good come to him that is alwayes occupied in euill: nor to him that giueth no almes.
\p
\v 4 Giue to the godly man, and helpe not a sinner.
\p
\v 5 Doe well vnto him that is lowly, but giue not to the vngodly: hold backe thy bread, and giue it not vnto him, lest he ouermaster thee thereby. For else thou shalt receiue twice as much euill, for all the good thou shalt haue done vnto him.
\p
\v 6 For the most High hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance vnto the vngodly, and keepeth them against the mightie day of their punishment.
\p
\v 7 Giue vnto the good, and helpe not the sinner.
\p
\v 8 A friend cannot be knowen in prosperitie, and an enemy cannot be hidden in aduersitie.
\p
\v 9 In the prosperitie of a man, enemies will be grieued, but in his aduersitie, euen a friend will depart.
\p
\v 10 Neuer trust thine enemie: for like as yron rusteth, so is his wickednesse.
\p
\v 11 Though he humble himselfe, and goe crouching, yet take good heed, and beware of him, and thou shalt bee vnto him, as if thou hadst wiped a looking glasse, and thou shalt knowe that his rust hath not beene altogether wiped away.
\p
\v 12 Set him not by thee, lest when he hath ouerthrowen thee, he stand vp in thy place, neither let him sit at thy right hand, lest he seeke to take thy seat, and thou at the last remember my wordes, and be pricked therewith.
\p
\v 13 Who will pitie a charmer that is bitten with a serpent, or any such as come nigh wilde beasts?
\p
\v 14 So one that goeth to a sinner, and is defiled with him in his sinnes, who will pitie?
\p
\v 15 For a while hee will abide with thee, but if thou begin to fall, he wil not tarie.
\p
\v 16 An enemie speaketh sweetly with his lippes, but in his heart he imagineth how to throw thee into a pit: hee will weepe with his eyes, but if he find opportunitie, hee will not be satisfied with blood.
\p
\v 17 If aduersitie come vpon thee, thou shalt find him there first, & though he pretend to helpe thee, yet shal he vndermine thee.
\p
\v 18 He will shake his head and clap his handes, and whisper much, and change his countenance.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 He that toucheth pitch, shal be defiled therewith, and hee that hath fellowship with a proude man, shall be like vnto him.
\p
\v 2 Burthen not thy selfe aboue thy power, while thou liuest, and haue no fellowship with one that is mightier, and richer then thy selfe. For how agree the kettle and the earthen pot together? for if the one be smitten against the other, it shall be broken.
\p
\v 3 The rich man hath done wrong, and yet he threatneth withall: the poore is wronged, and he must intreat also.
\p
\v 4 If thou be for his profit, he will vse thee: but if thou haue nothing, he will forsake thee.
\p
\v 5 If thou haue any thing, he will liue with thee, yea he will make thee bare, and will not be sorie for it.
\p
\v 6 If he haue need of thee, hee will deceiue thee, and smile vpon thee, and put thee in hope, he will speake thee faire, and say, What wantest thou?
\p
\v 7 And hee will shame thee by his meates, vntill he haue drawen thee drie twice or thrice, and at the last hee will laugh thee to scorne: afterward when he seeth thee, he will forsake thee, and shake his head at thee.
\p
\v 8 Beware that thou bee not deceiued, and brought downe in thy iolitie.
\p
\v 9 If thou be inuited of a mighty man, withdraw thy selfe, and so much the more will he inuite thee.
\p
\v 10 Presse thou not vpon him, lest thou be put backe, stand not farre off, lest thou be forgotten.
\p
\v 11 Affect not to be made equall vnto him in talke, and beleeue not his many words: for with much communication will he tempt thee, and smiling vpon thee will get out thy secrets.
\p
\v 12 But cruelly he will lay vp thy words, and will not spare to doe thee hurt, and to put thee in prison.
\p
\v 13 Obserue and take good heed, for thou walkest in peril of thy ouerthrowing: when thou hearest these things, awake in thy sleepe.
\p
\v 14 Loue the Lord all thy life, and call vpon him for thy saluation.
\p
\v 15 Euery beast loueth his like, and euery man loueth his neighbour.
\p
\v 16 All flesh consorteth according to kind, and a man will cleaue to his like:
\p
\v 17 What fellowship hath the wolfe with the lambe? so the sinner with the godly.
\p
\v 18 What agreement is there betweene the Hyena and a dogge? and what peace betweene the rich and the poore?
\p
\v 19 As the wilde asse is the lyons pray in the wildernesse: so the rich eate vp the poore.
\p
\v 20 As the proud hate humilitie: so doth the rich abhorre the poore.
\p
\v 21 A rich man beginning to fall, is held vp of his friends: but a poore man being downe, is thrust also away by his friends.
\p
\v 22 When a rich man is fallen, he hath many helpers: he speaketh things not to be spoken, and yet men iustifie him: the poore man slipt, and yet they rebuked him too: he spake wisely, and could haue no place.
\p
\v 23 When a rich man speaketh, euery man holdeth his tongue, and looke what hee sayeth, they extoll it to the clouds: but if the poore man speake, they say, What fellow is this? and if he stumble, they will helpe to ouerthrowe him.
\p
\v 24 Riches are good vnto him that hath no sinne, and pouerty is euill in the mouth of the vngodly.
\p
\v 25 The heart of a man changeth his countenance, whether it be for good or euill: and a merry heart maketh a cheerefull countenance.
\p
\v 26 A cheerefull countenance is a token of a heart that is in prosperity, and the finding out of parables, is a wearisome labour of the minde.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 Blessed is the man that hath not slipt with his mouth, and is not pricked with the multitude of sinnes.
\p
\v 2 Blessed is hee whose conscience hath not condemned him, and who is not fallen from his hope in the Lord.
\p
\v 3 Riches are not comely for a niggard: and what should an enuious man doe with money?
\p
\v 4 He that gathereth by defrauding his owne soule, gathereth for others, that shall spend his goods riotously.
\p
\v 5 Hee that is euill to himselfe, to whom will he be good? he shall not take pleasure in his goods.
\p
\v 6 There is none worse then he that enuieth himselfe; and this is a recompence of his wickednesse.
\p
\v 7 And if he doth good, he doth it vnwillingly, and at the last he will declare his wickednesse.
\p
\v 8 The enuious man hath a wicked eye, he turneth away his face and despiseth men.
\p
\v 9 A couetous mans eye is not satisfied with his portion, and the iniquity of the wicked dryeth vp his soule.
\p
\v 10 A wicked eye enuieth his bread, and he is a niggard at his table.
\p
\v 11 My sonne, according to thy habilitie doe good to thy selfe, and giue the Lord his due offering.
\p
\v 12 Remember that death will not be long in comming, and that the couenant of the graue is not shewed vnto thee.
\p
\v 13 Doe good vnto thy friend before thou die, and according to thy abilitie, stretch out thy hand and giue to him.
\p
\v 14 Defraud not thy selfe of the good day, and let not the part of a good desire ouerpasse thee.
\p
\v 15 Shalt thou not leaue thy trauailes vnto another? and thy labours to be diuided by lot?
\p
\v 16 Giue, and take, and sanctifie thy soule, for there is no seeking of dainties in the graue.
\p
\v 17 All flesh waxeth old as a garment: for the couenant from the beginning is; thou shalt die the death.
\p
\v 18 As of the greene leaues on a thicke tree, some fall, and some grow; so is the generation of flesh and blood, one commeth to an end, and another is borne.
\p
\v 19 Euery worke rotteth and consumeth away, and the worker therof shal goe withall.
\p
\v 20 Blessed is the man that doeth meditate good things in wisdome, and that reasoneth of holy things by his vnderstanding.
\p
\v 21 He that considereth her wayes in his heart, shall also haue vnderstanding in her secrets.
\p
\v 22 Goe after her as one that traceth, and lie in wait in her wayes.
\p
\v 23 Hee that prieth in at her windowes, shal also hearken at her doores.
\p
\v 24 Hee that doeth lodge neere her house, shall also fasten a pin in her walles.
\p
\v 25 He shall pitch his tent nigh vnto her, and shall lodge in a lodging where good things are.
\p
\v 26 He shal set his children vnder her shelter, and shall lodge vnder her branches.
\p
\v 27 By her he shall be couered from heat, and in her glory shall he dwell.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 He that feareth the Lord will doe good, and he that hath the knowledge of the Law shal obtaine her.
\p
\v 2 And as a mother shall she meet him, and receiue him as a wife maried of a virgin.
\p
\v 3 With the bread of vnderstanding shall she feed him, and giue him the water of wisedome to drinke.
\p
\v 4 Hee shall be stayed vpon her, and shall not be moued, and shall rely vpon her, and shall not be confounded.
\p
\v 5 Shee shall exalt him aboue his neighbours, and in the midst of the congregation shall she open his mouth.
\p
\v 6 He shall finde ioy, and a crowne of gladnesse, and she shall cause him to inherit an euerlasting name.
\p
\v 7 But foolish men shall not attaine vnto her, and sinners shall not see her.
\p
\v 8 For she is farre from pride, and men that are liers cannot remember her.
\p
\v 9 Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner, for it was not sent him of the Lord:
\p
\v 10 For praise shalbe vttered in wisdome, and the Lord wil prosper it.
\p
\v 11 Say not thou, It is through the Lord, that I fell away, for thou oughtest not to doe the things that he hateth.
\p
\v 12 Say not thou, He hath caused mee to erre, for hee hath no need of the sinfull man.
\p
\v 13 The Lord hateth all abomination, and they that feare God loue it not.
\p
\v 14 Hee himselfe made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his counsell,
\p
\v 15 If thou wilt, to keepe the Commandements, and to performe acceptable faithfulnesse.
\p
\v 16 He hath set fire and water before thee: stretch forth thy hand vnto whether thou wilt.
\p
\v 17 Before man is life and death, and whether him liketh shalbe giuen him.
\p
\v 18 For the wisedome of the Lord is great, and he is mighty in power, and beholdeth all things,
\p
\v 19 And his eyes are vpon them that feare him, & hee knoweth euery worke of man.
\p
\v 20 Hee hath commanded no man to do wickedly, neither hath he giuen any man license to sinne.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 Desire not a multitude of vnprofitable children, neither delight in vngodly sonnes.
\p
\v 2 Though they multiply, reioyce not in them, except the feare of the Lord be with them.
\p
\v 3 Trust not thou in their life, neither respect their multitude: for one that is iust, is better then a thousand, and better it is to die without children, then to haue them that are vngodly.
\p
\v 4 For by one that hath vnderstanding, shall the city be replenished, but the kindred of the wicked, shall speedily become desolate.
\p
\v 5 Many such things haue I seene with mine eyes, and mine eare hath heard greater things then these.
\p
\v 6 In the congregation of the vngodly, shall a fire be kindled, and in a rebellious nation, wrath is set on fire.
\p
\v 7 Hee was not pacified towards the olde giants, who fell away in the strength of their foolishnesse.
\p
\v 8 Neither spared he the place where Lot soiourned, but abhorred them for their pride.
\p
\v 9 Hee pitied not the people of perdition, who were taken away in their sinnes.
\p
\v 10 Nor the sixe hundreth thousand footmen, who were gathered together in the hardnesse of their hearts.
\p
\v 11 And if there be one stiffe-necked among the people, it is marueile, if he escape vnpunished; for mercy and wrath are with him, hee is mighty to forgiue, and to powre out displeasure.
\p
\v 12 As his mercy is great, so is his correction also: he iudgeth a man according to his workes.
\p
\v 13 The sinner shall not escape with his spoiles, and the patience of the godly shall not be frustrate.
\p
\v 14 Make way for euery worke of mercy: for euery man shall finde according to his workes.
\p
\v 15 The Lord hardened Pharaoh, that hee should not know him, that his powerfull workes might be knowen to the world.
\p
\v 16 His mercy is manifest to euery creature, and hee hath separated his light from the darkenesse with an Adamant.
\p
\v 17 Say not thou, I will hide my selfe from the Lord: shall any remember me from aboue? I shall not be remembred among so many people: for what is my soule among such an infinite number of creatures?
\p
\v 18 Behold, the heauen, and the heauen of heauens, the deepe and the earth, and all that therein is, shall be mooued when he shall visit.
\p
\v 19 The mountaines also, and foundations of the earth shall bee shaken with trembling, when the Lord looketh vpon them.
\p
\v 20 No heart can thinke vpon these things worthily: and who is able to conceiue his wayes?
\p
\v 21 It is a tempest, which no man can see: for the most part of his workes are hidde.
\p
\v 22 Who can declare the workes of his iustice? or who can endure them? for his Couenant is afarre off, and the triall of all things is in the ende.
\p
\v 23 He that wanteth vnderstanding, will thinke vpon vaine things: and a foolish man erring, imagineth follies.
\p
\v 24 My sonne, hearken vnto mee, and learne knowledge, and marke my words with thy heart.
\p
\v 25 I will shewe foorth doctrine in weight, and declare his knowledge exactly.
\p
\v 26 The works of the Lord are done in iudgement from the beginning: and from the time he made them, hee disposed the parts thereof.
\p
\v 27 Hee garnished his workes for euer, and in his hand are the chiefe of them vnto all generations: they neither labour, nor are weary, nor cease from their workes.
\p
\v 28 None of them hindreth another, and they shall neuer disobey his word.
\p
\v 29 After this, the Lord looked vpon the earth, and filled it with his blessings.
\p
\v 30 With all maner of liuing things hath hee couered the face thereof, and they shall returne into it againe.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 The Lord created man of the earth, and turned him into it againe.
\p
\v 2 He gaue them few dayes, and a short time, and power also ouer the things therein.
\p
\v 3 He endued them with strength by themselues, and made them according to his image,
\p
\v 4 And put the feare of man vpon all flesh, and gaue him dominion ouer beasts and foules.
\p
\v 5 They receiued the vse of the fiue operations of the Lord, and in the sixt place he imparted them vnderstanding, and in the seuenth, speech, an interpreter of the cogitations thereof.
\p
\v 6 Counsell, and a tongue, and eyes, eares, and a heart, gaue he them to vnderstand.
\p
\v 7 Withall, hee filled them with the knowledge of vnderstanding, & shewed them good and euill.
\p
\v 8 Hee set his eye vpon their hearts, that he might shew them the greatnesse of his workes.
\p
\v 9 He gaue them to glory in his marueilous actes for euer, that they might declare his works with vnderstanding.
\p
\v 10 And the elect shall praise his holy Name.
\p
\v 11 Beside this he gaue them knowledge, and the law of life for an heritage.
\p
\v 12 He made an euerlasting couenant with them, and shewed them his iudgements.
\p
\v 13 Their eyes saw the maiestie of his glory, and their eares heard his glorious voyce.
\p
\v 14 And he said vnto them, Beware of all vnrighteousnes, and he gaue euery man commandement concerning his neighbour,
\p
\v 15 Their wayes are euer before him, and shall not be hid from his eyes.
\p
\v 16 Euery man from his youth is giuen to euil, neither could they make to themselues fleshie hearts for stonie.
\p
\v 17 For in the diuision of the nations of the whole earth, he set a ruler ouer euery people, but Israel is the Lords portion.
\p
\v 18 Whom being his first borne, hee nourisheth with discipline, and giuing him the light of his loue, doth not forsake him.
\p
\v 19 Therefore all their workes are as the Sunne before him, and his eyes are continually vpon their wayes.
\p
\v 20 None of their vnrighteous deeds are hid from him, but all their sinnes are before the Lord:
\p
\v 21 But the Lord being gracious, and knowing his workemanship, neither left nor forsooke them, but spared them.
\p
\v 22 The almes of a man is as a signet with him, and he will keep the good deedes of man, as the apple of the eye, and giue repentance to his sonnes and daughters.
\p
\v 23 Afterward he will rise vp and reward them, and render their recompense vpon their heads.
\p
\v 24 But vnto them that repent, he granted them returne, and comforted those that faile in patience.
\p
\v 25 Returne vnto the Lord, and forsake thy sinnes, make thy prayer before his face, and offend lesse.
\p
\v 26 Turne againe to the most High, and turne away from iniquitie: for he will leade thee out of darkenesse into the light of health, and hate thou abomination vehemently.
\p
\v 27 Who shall praise the most High in the graue, in stead of them which liue and giue thanks?
\p
\v 28 Thankesgiuing perisheth from the dead, as from one that is not: the liuing and sound in heart, shall praise the Lord.
\p
\v 29 How great is the louing kindnes of the Lord our God, and his compassion vnto such as turne vnto him in holinesse?
\p
\v 30 For all things cannot bee in men, because &thorn;e sonne of man is not immortal.
\p
\v 31 What is brighter then the Sun? yet the light thereof faileth: and flesh and blood will imagine euill.
\p
\v 32 Hee vieweth the power of the height of heauen, and all men are but earth and ashes.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 Hee that liueth for euer, created all things in generall.
\p
\v 2 The Lord onely is righteous, and there is none other but he.
\p
\v 3 Who gouerneth the world with the palme of his hand, and all things obey his will, for he is the king of all, by his power diuiding holy things among them from prophane.
\p
\v 4 To whom hath he giuen power to declare his works? and who shall finde out his noble actes?
\p
\v 5 Who shall number the strength of his maiestie? and who shall also tel out his mercies?
\p
\v 6 As for the wonderous workes of the Lord, there may nothing bee taken from them, neither may any thing bee put vnto them, neither can the ground of them be found out.
\p
\v 7 When a man hath done, then he beginneth, and when hee leaueth off, then he shall be doubtfull.
\p
\v 8 What is man, and whereto serueth he? what is his good, & what is his euil?
\p
\v 9 The number of a mans dayes at the most are an hundred yeeres.
\p
\v 10 As a drop of water vnto the Sea, and a grauell stone in comparison of the sand, so are a thousand yeeres to the dayes of eternitie.
\p
\v 11 Therfore is God patient with them, & powreth forth his mercy vpon them.
\p
\v 12 He saw and perceiued their end to be euill, therefore he multiplied his compassion.
\p
\v 13 The mercy of man is toward his neighbour, but the mercy of the Lord is vpon all flesh: he reprooueth and nurtureth, and teacheth, & bringeth againe as a shepheard his flocke.
\p
\v 14 He hath mercy on them that receiue discipline, and that diligently seeke after his iudgements.
\p
\v 15 My sonne, blemish not thy good deeds, neither vse vncomfortable words when thou giuest any thing.
\p
\v 16 Shall not the deaw asswage the heate? so is a word better then a gift.
\p
\v 17 Loe is not a word better then a gift? but both are with a gracious man.
\p
\v 18 A foole will vpbraide churlishly, and a gift of the enuious consumeth the eyes.
\p
\v 19 Learne before thou speake, and vse phisicke, or euer thou be sicke.
\p
\v 20 Before iudgement examine thy selfe, and in the day of visitation thou shalt find mercy.
\p
\v 21 Humble thy selfe before thou be sicke, and in the time of sinnes shew repentance.
\p
\v 22 Let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vowe in due time, and deferre not vntill death to be iustified.
\p
\v 23 Before thou prayest, prepare thy selfe, and be not as one that tempteth the Lord.
\p
\v 24 Thinke vpon the wrath that shall be at the end; and the time of vengeance when he shall turne away his face.
\p
\v 25 When thou hast enough remember the time of hunger, and when thou art rich thinke vpon pouerty and need.
\p
\v 26 From the morning vntill the euening the time is changed, and all things are soone done before the Lord.
\p
\v 27 A wise man will feare in euery thing, and in the day of sinning he will beware of offence: but a foole will not obserue time.
\p
\v 28 Euery man of vnderstanding knoweth wisedome, and wil giue praise vnto him that found her.
\p
\v 29 They that were of vnderstanding in sayings, became also wise themselues, and powred forth exquisite parables.
\p
\v 30 Goe not after thy lustes, but refraine thy selfe from thine appetites.
\p
\v 31 If thou giuest thy soule the desires that please her, she will make thee a laughing stocke to thine enemies, that maligne thee.
\p
\v 32 Take not pleasure in much good cheere, neither be tyed to the expence thereof.
\p
\v 33 Be not made a begger by banquetting vpon borrowing, when thou hast nothing in thy purse, for thou shalt lie in waite for thy owne life: and be talked on.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 A labouring man that is giuen to drunkennesse shal not be rich, and hee that contemneth small things shall fall by little & little.
\p
\v 2 Wine and women will make men of vnderstanding to fall away, and he that cleaueth to harlots will become impudent.
\p
\v 3 Mothes and wormes shall haue him to heritage, and a bold man shall be taken away.
\p
\v 4 He that is hasty to giue credit is light minded, and he that sinneth shall offend against his owne soule.
\p
\v 5 Who so taketh pleasure in wickednesse shall be condemned, but he that resisteth pleasures, crowneth his life.
\p
\v 6 He that can rule his tongue shall liue without strife, and he that hateth babbling, shall haue lesse euill.
\p
\v 7 Rehearse not vnto another that which is told vnto thee, and thou shalt fare neuer the worse.
\p
\v 8 Whether it be to friend or foe, talk not of other mens liues, and if thou canst without offence reueale them not.
\p
\v 9 For he heard and obserued thee, and when time commeth he will hate thee.
\p
\v 10 If thou hast heard a word, let it die with thee, and be bold it will not burst thee.
\p
\v 11 A foole trauaileth with a word, as a woman in labour of a child.
\p
\v 12 As an arrowe that sticketh in a mans thigh, so is a word within a fooles belly.
\p
\v 13 Admonish a friend, it may be he hath not done it, and if he haue done it that he doe it no more.
\p
\v 14 Admonish thy friend, it may be he hath not said it, and if he haue, that he speake it not againe.
\p
\v 15 Admonish a friend: for many times it is a slander, & beleeue not euery tale.
\p
\v 16 There is one that slippeth in his speach, but not from his heart, and who is he that hath not offended with his tongue?
\p
\v 17 Admonish thy neighbour before thou threaten him, and not being angry giue place to the Law of the most high.
\p
\v 18 The feare of the Lord is the first step to be accepted of him, and wisedome obtaineth his loue.
\p
\v 19 The knowledge of the Commandements of the Lord, is the doctrine of life, and they that do things that please him, shall receiue the fruit of the tree of immortalitie.
\p
\v 20 The feare of the Lord is all wisedome, and in all wisedome is the performance of the Law, and the knowledge of his omnipotencie.
\p
\v 21 If a seruant say to his master, I will not doe as it pleaseth thee, though afterward hee doe it, hee angereth him that nourisheth him.
\p
\v 22 The knowledge of wickednes is not wisedome, neither at any time the counsell of sinners, prudence.
\p
\v 23 There is a wickednesse, and the same an abomination, and there is a foole wanting in wisedome.
\p
\v 24 He that hath smal vnderstanding and feareth God, is better then one that hath much wisedome, and transgresseth the Law of the most High.
\p
\v 25 There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same is vniust, and there is one that turneth aside to make iudgement appeare: and there is a wise man that iustifieth in iudgement.
\p
\v 26 There is a wicked man that hangeth downe his head sadly; but inwardly he is full of deceit,
\p
\v 27 Casting downe his countenance, and making as if he heard not: where he is not knowen, he will do thee a mischiefe before thou be aware.
\p
\v 28 And if for want of power hee be hindered from sinning, yet when he findeth opportunitie he wil doe euil.
\p
\v 29 A man may bee knowen by his looke, and one that hath vnderstanding, by his countenance, when thou meetest him.
\p
\v 30 A mans attire, and excessiue laughter, and gate, shew what he is.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 There is a reproofe that is not comely: againe some man holdeth his tongue, and he is wise.
\p
\v 2 It is much better to reprooue, then to be angry secretly, and he that confesseth his fault, shall be preserued from hurt.
\p
\v 3 How good is it when thou art reproued, to shew repentance? for so shalt thou escape wilfull sinne.
\p
\v 4 As is the lust of an Eunuch to defloure a virgine; so is he that executeth iudgement with violence.
\p
\v 5 There is one that keepeth silence and is found wise: and another by much babling becommeth hatefull.
\p
\v 6 Some man holdeth his tongue, because hee hath not to answere, and some keepeth silence, knowing his time.
\p
\v 7 A wise man wil hold his tongue till he see opportunitie: but a babler and a foole will regard no time.
\p
\v 8 He that vseth many words shalbe abhorred; and hee that taketh to himselfe authoritie therein, shalbe hated.
\p
\v 9 There is a sinner that hath good successe in euill things; and there is a gaine that turneth to losse.
\p
\v 10 There is a gift that shall not profit thee; and there is a gift whose recompence is double.
\p
\v 11 There is an abasement because of glory; and there is that lifteth vp his head from a low estate.
\p
\v 12 There is that buyeth much for a little, and repayeth it seuen fold.
\p
\v 13 A wise man by his words maketh himselfe beloued: but the graces of fooles shalbe powred out.
\p
\v 14 The gift of a foole shall doe thee no good when thou hast it; neither yet of the enuious for his necessitie: for hee looketh to receiue many things for one.
\p
\v 15 Hee giueth little and vpbraideth much; hee openeth his mouth like a crier; to day he lendeth, and to morrow will he aske it againe: such an one is to be hated of God and man.
\p
\v 16 The foole saith, I haue no friends, I haue no thanke for all my good deeds: and they that eate my bread speake euill of me.
\p
\v 17 How oft, and of how many shall he be laughed to scorne? for hee knoweth not aright what it is to haue; and it is all one vnto him, as if he had it not.
\p
\v 18 To slip vpon a pauement, is better then to slip with the tongue: so, the fall of the wicked shall come speedily.
\p
\v 19 An vnseasonable tale will alwayes be in the mouth of the vnwise.
\p
\v 20 A wise sentence shall be reiected when it commeth out of a fools mouth: for he will not speake it in due season.
\p
\v 21 There is that is hindred from sinning through want: and when hee taketh rest, he shall not be troubled.
\p
\v 22 There is that destroyeth his owne soule through bashfulnesse, and by accepting of persons ouerthroweth himselfe.
\p
\v 23 There is that for bashfulnes promiseth to his friend, and maketh him his enemy for nothing.
\p
\v 24 A lie is a foule blot in a man, yet it is continually in the mouth of the vntaught.
\p
\v 25 A thiefe is better then a man that is accustomed to lie: but they both shall haue destruction to heritage.
\p
\v 26 The disposition of a liar is dishonourable, and his shame is euer with him.
\p
\v 27 A wise man shall promote himselfe to honour with his words: and hee that hath vnderstanding, will please great men.
\p
\v 28 He that tilleth his land, shall increase his heape: and he that pleaseth great men, shal get pardon for iniquity.
\p
\v 29 Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and stoppe vp his mouth that he cannot reprooue.
\p
\v 30 Wisedome that is hidde, and treasure that is hoarded vp, what profit is in them both?
\p
\v 31 Better is he that hideth his folly, then a man that hideth his wisedome.
\p
\v 32 Necessary patience in seeking the Lord, is better then he that leadeth his life without a guide.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 My sonne, hast thou sinned? doe so no more, but aske pardon for thy former sinnes.
\p
\v 2 Flee from sinne as from the face of a Serpent: for if thou commest too neere it, it will bite thee: the teeth thereof, are as the teeth of a lyon, slaying the soules of men.
\p
\v 3 All iniquitie is as a two edged sword, the wounds whereof cannot be healed.
\p
\v 4 To terrifie and doe wrong, will waste riches: thus the house of proude men shalbe made desolate.
\p
\v 5 A prayer out of a poore mans mouth reacheth to the eares of God, and his iudgement commeth speedily.
\p
\v 6 He that hateth to be reprooued, is in the way of sinners: but hee that feareth the Lord, will repent from his heart.
\p
\v 7 An eloquent man is knowen farre and neere, but a man of vnderstanding knoweth when he slippeth.
\p
\v 8 He that buildeth his house with other mens money, is like one that gathereth himselfe stones for the tombe of his buriall.
\p
\v 9 The congregation of the wicked is like tow wrapped together: and the end of them is a flame of fire to destroy them.
\p
\v 10 The way of sinners is made plaine with stones, but at the ende thereof is the pit of hell.
\p
\v 11 Hee that keepeth the Law of the Lord, getteth the vnderstanding thereof: and the perfection of the feare of the Lord, is wisedome.
\p
\v 12 He that is not wise, will not be taught: but there is a wisedome which multiplieth bitternesse.
\p
\v 13 The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood: and his counsell is like a pure fountaine of life.
\p
\v 14 The inner parts of a foole, are like a broken vessell, and he will holde no knowledge as long as he liueth.
\p
\v 15 If a skilfull man heare a wise word, hee will commend it, and adde vnto it: but assoone as one of no vnderstanding heareth it, it displeaseth him, and he casteth it behinde his backe.
\p
\v 16 The talking of a foole is like a burden in the way: but grace shall be found in the lips of the wise.
\p
\v 17 They inquire at the mouth of the wise man in the congregation, and they shall ponder his words in their heart.
\p
\v 18 As is a house that is destroyed, so is wisedome to a foole: and the knowledge of the vnwise, is as talke without sense.
\p
\v 19 Doctrine vnto fooles, is as fetters on the feete, and like manacles on the right hand.
\p
\v 20 A foole lifteth vp his voyce with laughter, but a wise man doeth scarce smile a litle.
\p
\v 21 Learning is vnto a wise man, as an ornament of gold, and like a bracelet vpon his right arme.
\p
\v 22 A foolish mans foote is soone in his neighbours house: but a man of experience is ashamed of him.
\p
\v 23 A foole will peepe in at the doore into the house, but he that is well nurtured, will stand without.
\p
\v 24 It is the rudenesse of a man to hearken at the doore: but a wise man will be grieued with the disgrace.
\p
\v 25 The lips of talkers will bee telling such things as pertaine not vnto them: but the words of such as haue vnderstanding, are weighed in the ballance.
\p
\v 26 The heart of fooles is in their mouth, but the mouth of the wise is in their heart.
\p
\v 27 When the vngodly curseth Satan, he curseth his owne soule.
\p
\v 28 A whisperer defileth his owne soule, and is hated wheresoeuer hee dwelleth.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 A slouthful man is compared to a filthy stone, and euery one will hisse him out to his disgrace.
\p
\v 2 A slouthfull man is compared to the filth of a dunghill: euery man that takes it vp, will shake his hand.
\p
\v 3 An euill nurtured sonne is the dishonour of his father that begate him: and a foolish daughter is borne to his losse.
\p
\v 4 A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband: but shee that liueth dishonestly, is her fathers heauinesse.
\p
\v 5 Shee that is bold, dishonoureth both her father and her husband, but they both shall despise her.
\p
\v 6 A tale out of season is as musick in mourning: but stripes and correction of wisedome are neuer out of time.
\p
\v 7 Who so teacheth a foole, is as one that gleweth a potsheard together, and as hee that waketh one from a sound sleepe.
\p
\v 8 Hee that telleth a tale to a foole, speaketh to one in a slumber: when hee hath told his tale, he will say, What is the matter?
\p
\v 9 If children liue honestly, and haue wherwithall, they shall couer the basenesse of their parents.
\p
\v 10 But children being haughtie through disdaine, and want of nurture, doe staine the nobilitie of their kinred.
\p
\v 11 Weepe for the dead, for hee hath lost the light: and weepe for the foole, for he wanteth vnderstanding: make litle weeping for the dead, for hee is at rest: but the life of the foole is worse then death.
\p
\v 12 Seuen dayes doe men mourne for him that is dead; but for a foole, and an vngodly man, all the dayes of his life.
\p
\v 13 Talke not much with a foole, and goe not to him that hath no vnderstanding, beware of him lest thou haue trouble, and thou shalt neuer be defiled with his fooleries: depart from him, and thou shalt find rest, and neuer bee disquieted with madnesse.
\p
\v 14 What is heauier then lead? and what is the name thereof, but a foole?
\p
\v 15 Sand, and salt, and a masse of yron is easier to beare then a man without vnderstanding.
\p
\v 16 As timber girt and bound together in a building, cannot be loosed with shaking: so the heart that is stablished by aduised counsel, shal feare at no time.
\p
\v 17 A heart setled vpon a thought of vnderstanding, is as a faire plaistering on the wall of a gallerie.
\p
\v 18 Pales set on an high place will neuer stand against the wind: so a feareful heart in the imagination of a foole, can not stand against any feare.
\p
\v 19 He that pricketh the eye, wil make teares to fall: and he that pricketh the heart, maketh it to shewe her knowledge.
\p
\v 20 Who so casteth a stone at the birds, frayeth them away, and he that vpbraideth his friend, breaketh friendship.
\p
\v 21 Though thou drewest a sword at thy friend, yet despaire not, for there way be a returning (to fauour.)
\p
\v 22 If thou hast opened thy mouth against thy friend, feare not, for there may be a reconciliation: except for vpbraiding, or pride, or disclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound, for, for these things euery friend will depart.
\p
\v 23 Be faithfull to thy neighbour in his pouertie, that thou mayest reioyce in his prosperitie: abide stedfast vnto him in the time of his trouble, that thou mayest bee heire with him in his heritage: for a meane estate is not alwayes to be contemned, nor the rich that is foolish, to be had in admiration.
\p
\v 24 As the vapour and smoke of a furnace goeth before the fire: so reuiling before blood.
\p
\v 25 I will not be ashamed to defend a friend: neither will I hide my selfe from him.
\p
\v 26 And if any euill happen vnto me by him, euery one that heareth it will beware of him.
\p
\v 27 Who shall set a watch before my mouth, and a seale of wisedome vpon my lippes, that I fall not suddenly by them, & that my tongue destroy me not?

\c 23
\p
\v 1 O Lord, father and gouernour of all my whole life, leaue me not to their counsels, and let me not fall by them.
\p
\v 2 Who will set scourges ouer my thoughts, and the discipline of wisedome ouer mine heart? that they spare me not for mine ignorances and it passe not by my sinnes:
\p
\v 3 Least mine ignorances increase, and my sinnes abound to my destruction, and I fall before mine aduersaries, and mine enemie reioyce ouer mee, whose hope is farre from thy mercy.
\p
\v 4 O Lord, father and God of my life, giue me not a proud looke, but turne away from thy seruants alwaies a haughty minde:
\p
\v 5 Turne away from mee vaine hopes, and concupiscence, and thou shalt hold him vp that is desirous alwaies to serue thee.
\p
\v 6 Let not the greedinesse of the belly, nor lust of the flesh take hold of me, and giue not ouer me thy seruant into an impudent minde.
\p
\v 7 Heare, O yee children, the discipline of the mouth: He that keepeth it, shall neuer be taken in his lippes.
\p
\v 8 The sinner shall be left in his foolishnesse: both the euill speaker and the proud shall fall thereby.
\p
\v 9 Accustome not thy mouth to swearing: neither vse thy selfe to the naming of the holy one.
\p
\v 10 For as a seruant that is continually beaten, shall not be without a blew marke: so hee that sweareth and nameth God continually, shal not be faultlesse.
\p
\v 11 A man that vseth much swearing shall be filled with iniquity, and the plague shall neuer depart from his house: If he shall offend, his sinne shall be vpon him: and if he acknowledge not his sinne, hee maketh a double offence, and if he sweare in vaine, he shall not be innocent, but his house shall be full of calamities.
\p
\v 12 There is a word that is clothed about with death: God graunt that it be not found in the heritage of Iacob, for all such things shall be farre from the godly, and they shall not wallow in their sinnes.
\p
\v 13 Use not thy mouth to vntemperate swearing, for therein is the word of sinne.
\p
\v 14 Remember thy father and thy mother, when thou sittest among great men. Be not forgetfull before them, and so thou by thy custome become a foole, and wish that thou hadst not beene borne, and curse the day of thy natiuitie.
\p
\v 15 The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words, will neuer be reformed all the daies of his life.
\p
\v 16 Two sorts of men multiply sinne, and the third will bring wrath: a hot minde is as a burning fire, it will neuer be quenched till it be consumed: a fornicatour in the body of his flesh, will neuer cease till he hath kindled a fire.
\p
\v 17 All bread is sweete to a whoremonger, he will not leaue off till he die.
\p
\v 18 A man that breaketh wedlocke, saying thus in his heart, Who seeth me? I am compassed about with darknesse: the walles couer me; & no body seeth me, what neede I to feare? The most high wil not remember my sinnes:
\p
\v 19 Such a man only feareth the eies of men, and knoweth not that the eies of the Lord are tenne thousand times brighter then the Sunne, beholding all the waies of men, and considering the most secret parts.
\p
\v 20 He knew all things ere euer they were created, so also after they were perfited, he looked vpon them all:
\p
\v 21 This man shall bee punished in the streets of the citie, and where he suspecteth not, he shall be taken.
\p
\v 22 Thus shall it goe also with the wife, that leaueth her husband, and bringeth in an heire by another:
\p
\v 23 For first she hath disobeyed the Law of the most High: and secondly, she hath trespassed against her owne husband, and thirdly, she hath played the whore in adultery, and brought children by another man.
\p
\v 24 Shee shall be brought out into the congregation, and inquisition shalbe made of her children.
\p
\v 25 Her children shall not take root, and her branches shall bring foorth no fruit.
\p
\v 26 She shall leaue her memorie to be cursed, and her reproch shall not be blotted out.
\p
\v 27 And they that remaine, shall know that there is nothing better then the feare of the Lord, and that there is nothing sweeter then to take heed vnto the Commandement of the Lord.
\p
\v 28 It is great glory to follow the Lord, & to be receiued of him is long life.

\c 24
\p
\v 1 Wisedome shall praise her selfe, and shall glory in the midst of her people.
\p
\v 2 In the Congregation of the most high, shall she open her mouth, and triumph before his power.
\p
\v 3 I came out of the mouth of the most High, and couered the earth as a cloud.
\p
\v 4 I dwelt in high places, and my throne is in a cloudy pillar.
\p
\v 5 I alone compassed the circuit of heauen, and walked in the bottome of the deepe.
\p
\v 6 In the waues of the sea, and in all the earth, and in euery people, and nation, I got a possession.
\p
\v 7 With all these I sought rest: and in whose inheritance shall I abide?
\p
\v 8 So the creatour of all things gaue mee a commandement, and hee that made me, caused my tabernacle to rest: and said, Let thy dwelling be in Iacob, and thine inheritance in Israel.
\p
\v 9 Hee created mee from the beginning before the world, and I shall neuer faile.
\p
\v 10 In the holy Tabernacle I serued before him: and so was I established in Sion.
\p
\v 11 Likewise in the beloued citie he gaue mee rest, and in Ierusalem was my power.
\p
\v 12 And I tooke roote in an honourable people, euen in the portion of the Lords inheritance.
\p
\v 13 I was exalted like a Cedar in Libanus, and as a Cypresse tree vpon the mountaines of Hermon.
\p
\v 14 I was exalted like a palme tree in Engaddi, and as a rose-plant in Iericho, as a faire oliue tree in a pleasant fielde, and grew vp as a planetree by the water.
\p
\v 15 I gaue a sweete smell like cinamon, and aspalathus, and I yeelded a pleasant odour like the best mirrhe, as Galbanum and Onix, and sweet Storax, and as the sume of franckincense in the Tabernacle.
\p
\v 16 As the Turpentine tree, I stretched out my branches, and my branches are the branches of honour and grace.
\p
\v 17 As the Uine brought I foorth pleasant sauour, and my flowers are the fruit of honour and riches.
\p
\v 18 I am the mother of faire loue, and feare, and knowledge, and holy hope, I therefore being eternall, am giuen to all my children which are named of him.
\p
\v 19 Come vnto me all ye that be desirous of mee, and fill your selues with my fruits.
\p
\v 20 For my memorial is sweeter then hony, and mine inheritance then the hony combe.
\p
\v 21 They that eate mee shall yet be hungry, and they that drinke me shall yet be thirstie.
\p
\v 22 He that obeyeth me, shall neuer be confounded, and they that worke by me, shall not doe amisse.
\p
\v 23 All these things are the booke of the Couenant of the most high God, euen the Law which Moses commanded for an heritage vnto the Congregations of Iacob.
\p
\v 24 Faint not to bee strong in the Lord; that he may confirme you, cleaue vnto him: for the Lord Almightie is God alone, and besides him there is no other Sauiour.
\p
\v 25 He filleth all things with his wisdome, as Physon, and as Tigris in the time of the new fruits.
\p
\v 26 He maketh the vnderstanding to abound like Euphrates, and as Iorden in the time of the haruest.
\p
\v 27 He maketh the doctrine of knowledge appeare as the light, and as Geon in the time of vintage.
\p
\v 28 The first man knew her not perfectly: no more shall the last finde her out.
\p
\v 29 For her thoughts are more then the Sea, and her counsels profounder then the great deepe.
\p
\v 30 I also came out as a brooke from a riuer, and as a conduit into a garden.
\p
\v 31 I said, I will water my best garden, and will water abundantly my garden bedde: and loe, my brooke became a riuer, and my riuer became a sea.
\p
\v 32 I will yet make doctrine to shine as the morning, and will send forth her light afarre off.
\p
\v 33 I will yet powre out doctrine as prophecie, and leaue it to all ages for euer.
\p
\v 34 Behold that I haue not laboured for my selfe onely, but for all them that seeke wisedome.

\c 25
\p
\v 1 In three things I was beautified, and stoode vp beautiful, both before God and men: the vnitie of brethren, the loue of neighbours, a man and a wife that agree together.
\p
\v 2 Three sorts of men my soule hateth, and I am greatly offended at their life: a poore man that is proud, a rich man that is a lyar, and an olde adulterer that doteth.
\p
\v 3 If thou hast gathered nothing in thy youth, how canst thou finde any thing in thine age?
\p
\v 4 Oh how comely a thing is iudgement for gray haires, and for ancient men to know counsell?
\p
\v 5 Oh how comely is the wisedome of olde men, and vnderstanding and counsell to men of honour?
\p
\v 6 Much experience is the crowne of olde men, and the feare of God is their glory.
\p
\v 7 There be nine things which I haue iudged in mine heart to be happy, and the tenth I will vtter with my tongue: a man that hath ioy of his children, and he that liueth to see the fall of his enemie.
\p
\v 8 Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of vnderstanding, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not serued a man more vnworthy then himselfe.
\p
\v 9 Well is him that hath found prudence, and he that speaketh in the eares of him that will heare.
\p
\v 10 Oh how great is he that findeth wisedome! yet is there none aboue him that feareth the Lord.
\p
\v 11 But the loue of the Lord passeth all things for illumination: he that holdeth it, whereto shall he be likened?
\p
\v 12 The feare of the Lord is the beginning of his loue: and faith is the beginning of cleauing vnto him.
\p
\v 13 Giue mee any plague, but the plague of the heart: and any wickednesse, but the wickednesse of a woman.
\p
\v 14 And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate me: and any reuenge, but the reuenge of enemies.
\p
\v 15 There is no head aboue the head of a serpent, and there is no wrath aboue the wrath of an enemie.
\p
\v 16 I had rather dwell with a lyon and a dragon, then to keepe house with a wicked woman.
\p
\v 17 The wickednesse of a woman changeth her face, and darkeneth her countenance like sackecloth.
\p
\v 18 Her husband shall sit among his neighbours: and when hee heareth it, shall sigh bitterly.
\p
\v 19 All wickednesse is but little to the wickednesse of a woman: let the portion of a sinner fall vpon her.
\p
\v 20 As the climbing vp a sandie way is to the feete of the aged, so is a wife full of words to a quiet man.
\p
\v 21 Stumble not at the beautie of a woman, and desire her not for pleasure.
\p
\v 22 A woman, if shee maintaine her husband, is full of anger, impudencie, and much reproch.
\p
\v 23 A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh a heauie countenance, and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distresse maketh weake hands, and feeble knees.
\p
\v 24 Of the woman came the beginning of sinne, & through her wee all die.
\p
\v 25 Giue the water no passage: neither a wicked woman libertie to gad abroad.
\p
\v 26 If she goe not as thou wouldest haue her, cut her off from thy flesh, and giue her a bill of diuorce, and let her goe.

\c 26
\p
\v 1 Blessed is the man that hath a vertuous wife, for the number of his dayes shall be double.
\p
\v 2 A vertuous woman reioyceth her husband, and he shall fulfill the yeeres of his life in peace.
\p
\v 3 A good wife is a good portion, which shall be giuen in the portion of them that feare the Lord.
\p
\v 4 Whether a man be rich or poore, if he haue a good heart towards the Lord, he shall at all times reioyce with a cheerefull countenance.
\p
\v 5 There bee three things that mine heart feareth: and for the fourth I was sore afraid: the slander of a citie, the gathering together of an vnruly multitude, and a false accusation: all these are worse then death.
\p
\v 6 But a griefe of heart and sorrow, is a woman that is ielous ouer another woman, and a scourge of the tongue which communicateth withall.
\p
\v 7 An euil wife is a yoke shaken to and fro: he that hath hold of her, is as though he held a scorpion.
\p
\v 8 A drunken woman and a gadder abroad, causeth great anger, and shee will not couer her owne shame.
\p
\v 9 The whordome of a woman may be knowen in her haughtie lookes, and eye lids.
\p
\v 10 If thy daughter be shamelesse, keepe her in straitly: lest she abuse her selfe through ouermuch libertie.
\p
\v 11 Watch ouer an impudent eye: and marueile not, if shee trespasse against thee.
\p
\v 12 Shee will open her mouth as a thirstie traueiler, when he hath found a fountaine: and drinke of euery water neere her: by euery hedge will she sit downe, and open her quiuer against euery arrow.
\p
\v 13 The grace of a wife delighteth her husband, and her discretion will fat his bones.
\p
\v 14 A silent and louing woman is a gift of the Lord, and there is nothing so much worth, as a mind well instructed.
\p
\v 15 A shamefast and faithfull woman is a double grace, and her continent mind cannot be valued.
\p
\v 16 As the Sunne when it ariseth in the high heauen: so is the beautie of a good wife in the ordering of her house.
\p
\v 17 As the cleare light is vpon the holy candlesticke: so is the beautie of the face in ripe age.
\p
\v 18 As the golden pillars are vpon the sockets of siluer: so are the faire feete with a constant heart.
\p
\v 19 My sonne, keepe the flowre of thine age sound: and giue not thy strength to strangers.
\p
\v 20 When thou hast gotten a fruitfull possession through all the field: sowe it with thine owne seede, trusting in the goodnesse of thy stocke.
\p
\v 21 So thy race which thou leauest shalbe magnified, hauing the confidence of their good descent.
\p
\v 22 An harlot shall bee accounted as spittle: but a maried woman is a towre against death to her husband.
\p
\v 23 A wicked woman is giuen as a portion to a wicked man: but a godly woman is giuen to him that feareth the Lord.
\p
\v 24 A dishonest woman contemneth shame, but an honest woman will reuerence her husband.
\p
\v 25 A shamelesse woman shalbe counted as a dog: but she that is shamefast will feare the Lord.
\p
\v 26 A woman that honoureth her husband, shall bee iudged wise of all: but she that dishonoureth him in her pride, shall be counted vngodly of all.
\p
\v 27 A loude crying woman, and a scolde, shall be sought out to driue away the enemies.
\p
\v 28 There be two things that grieue my heart: and the third maketh me angry: a man of warre that suffereth pouerty, and men of vnderstanding that are not set by: and one that returneth from righteousnesse to sinne: the Lord prepareth such a one for the sword.
\p
\v 29 A merchant shall hardly keepe himselfe from doing wrong: and an huckster shall not be freed from sinne.

\c 27
\p
\v 1 Many haue sinned for a smal matter: & he that seeketh for abundance will turne his eies away.
\p
\v 2 As a naile sticketh fast betweene the ioynings of the stones: so doth sinne sticke close betweene buying and selling.
\p
\v 3 Unlesse a man hold himselfe diligently in the feare of the Lord, his house shall soone be ouerthrowen.
\p
\v 4 As when one sifteth with a sieue, the refuse remaineth, so the filth of man in his talke.
\p
\v 5 The furnace prooueth the potters vessell: so the triall of man is in his reasoning.
\p
\v 6 The fruite declareth if the tree haue beene dressed: so is the vtterance of a conceit in the heart of man.
\p
\v 7 Praise no man before thou hearest him speake, for this is the triall of men.
\p
\v 8 If thou followest righteousnesse, thou shalt obtaine her, and put her on, as a glorious long robe.
\p
\v 9 The birds will resort vnto their like, so will truth returne vnto them that practise in her.
\p
\v 10 As the Lyon lieth in waite for the pray: so sinne for them that worke iniquity.
\p
\v 11 The discourse of a godly man is alwaies with wisedome: but a foole changeth as the Moone.
\p
\v 12 If thou be among the vndiscreet, obserue the time: but be continually among men of vnderstanding.
\p
\v 13 The discourse of fooles is irksome, and their sport is in the wantonnesse of sinne.
\p
\v 14 The talke of him that sweareth much, maketh the haire stand vpright: and their braules make one stop his eares.
\p
\v 15 The strife of the proud is blood-shedding, and their reuilings are grieuous to the eare.
\p
\v 16 Who so discouereth secrets, looseth his credit: and shall neuer find friend to his minde.
\p
\v 17 Loue thy friend, and be faithfull vnto him: but if thou bewrayest his secrets, follow no more after him.
\p
\v 18 For as a man hath destroyed his enemie: so hast thou lost the loue of thy neighbour.
\p
\v 19 As one that letteth a bird goe out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour goe; and shalt not get him againe.
\p
\v 20 Follow after him no more, for he is too far off, he is as a roe escaped out of the snare.
\p
\v 21 As for a wound it may be bound vp, and after reuiling there may be reconcilement: but he that bewrayeth secrets is without hope.
\p
\v 22 He that winketh with the eies worketh euil, and he that knoweth him will depart from him.
\p
\v 23 When thou art present he will speake sweetly, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings.
\p
\v 24 I haue hated many things, but nothing like him, for the Lord will hate him.
\p
\v 25 Who so casteth a stone on high, casteth it on his owne head, and a deceitfull stroke shall make wounds.
\p
\v 26 Who so diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that setteth a trap shall be taken therein.
\p
\v 27 He that worketh mischiefe, it shall fall vpon him, and he shall not know whence it commeth.
\p
\v 28 Mockery and reproach are from the proud: but vengeance as a Lyon shall lie in waite for them.
\p
\v 29 They that reioyce at the fall of the righteous shalbe taken in the snare, and anguish shall consume them before they die.
\p
\v 30 Malice and wrath, euen these are abhominations, and the sinfull man shall haue them both.

\c 28
\p
\v 1 He that reuengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely keepe his sinnes (in remembrance.)
\p
\v 2 Forgiue thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done vnto thee, so shall thy sinnes also be forgiuen when thou prayest.
\p
\v 3 One man beareth hatred against another, and doeth he seeke pardon from the Lord?
\p
\v 4 Hee sheweth no mercy to a man, which is like himselfe: and doeth hee aske forgiuenesse of his owne sinnes?
\p
\v 5 If he that is but flesh nourish hatred, who will intreat for pardon of his sinnes?
\p
\v 6 Remember thy end, and let enimitie cease, remember corruption and death, and abide in the Commandements.
\p
\v 7 Remember the Commaundements, & beare no malice to thy neighbour: remember the Couenant of the highest, and winke at ignorance.
\p
\v 8 Abstaine from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sinnes: for a furious man will kindle strife.
\p
\v 9 A sinfull man disquieteth friends, and maketh debate among them that be at peace.
\p
\v 10 As the matter of the fire is, so it burneth: and as a mans strength is, so is his wrath, and according to his riches his anger riseth, and the stronger they are which contend, the more they will be inflamed.
\p
\v 11 An hastie contention kindleth a fire, and an hasty fighting sheddeth blood.
\p
\v 12 If thou blow the sparke, it shall burne: if thou spit vpon it, it shall bee quenched, and both these come out of thy mouth.
\p
\v 13 Curse the whisperer, and double tongued: for such haue destroyed many that were at peace.
\p
\v 14 A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driuen them from nation to nation, strong cities hath it pulled down, and ouerthrowen the houses of great men.
\p
\v 15 A backbiting tongue hath cast out vertuous women, and depriued them of their labours.
\p
\v 16 Who so hearkeneth vnto it, shall neuer finde rest, and neuer dwel quietly.
\p
\v 17 The stroke of the whip maketh markes in the flesh, but the stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones.
\p
\v 18 Many haue fallen by the edge of the sword: but not so many as haue fallen by the tongue.
\p
\v 19 Well is hee that is defended from it, and hath not passed through the venime thereof: who hath not drawen the yoke thereof, nor hath bene bound in her bands.
\p
\v 20 For the yoke thereof is a yoke of yron, and the bands thereof are bandes of brasse.
\p
\v 21 The death therof is an euil death, the graue were better then it.
\p
\v 22 It shall not haue rule ouer them that feare God, neither shall they be burnt with the flame thereof.
\p
\v 23 Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it, and it shall burne in them, and not be quenched, it shalbe sent vpon them as a Lion, and deuoure them as a Leopard.
\p
\v 24 Looke that thou hedge thy possession about with thornes, and binde vp thy siluer and gold:
\p
\v 25 And weigh thy words in a ballance, and make a doore and barre for thy mouth.
\p
\v 26 Beware thou slide not by it, lest thou fall before him that lieth in wait.

\c 29
\p
\v 1 Hee that is mercifull, will lende vnto his neighbour, and hee that strengthneth his hande, keepeth the Commandements.
\p
\v 2 Lend to thy neighbour in time of his need, and pay thou thy neighbour againe in due season.
\p
\v 3 Keepe thy word & deale faithfully with him, and thou shalt alwaies finde the thing that is necessary for thee.
\p
\v 4 Many when a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found, and put them to trouble that helped them.
\p
\v 5 Till he hath receiued, he will kisse a mans hand: and for his neighbours money he will speake submissely: but when he should repay, he will prolong the time, and returne words of griefe, and complaine of the time.
\p
\v 6 If he preuaile, he shall hardly receiue the halfe, and he will count as if he had found it: if not; he hath depriued him of his money, and he hath gotten him an enemy without cause: he payeth him with cursings, and raylings: and for honour he will pay him disgrace.
\p
\v 7 Many therefore haue refused to lend for other mens ill dealing, fearing to be defrauded.
\p
\v 8 Yet haue thou patience with a man in poore estate, and delay not to shew him mercy.
\p
\v 9 Helpe the poore for the commandements sake, and turne him not away because of his pouertie.
\p
\v 10 Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend, and let it not rust vnder a stone to be lost.
\p
\v 11 Lay vp thy treasure according to the commandements of the most high, and it shall bring thee more profite then golde.
\p
\v 12 Shut vp almes in thy storehouses: and it shall deliuer thee from all affliction.
\p
\v 13 It shal fight for thee against thine enemies, better then a mightie shield and strong speare.
\p
\v 14 An honest man is suretie for his neighbour: but hee that is impudent, will forsake him.
\p
\v 15 Forget not the friendship of thy suretie: for hee hath giuen his life for thee.
\p
\v 16 A sinner will ouerthrow the good estate of his suretie:
\p
\v 17 And he that is of an vnthankfull minde, will leaue him in danger that deliuered him.
\p
\v 18 Suretiship hath vndone many of good estate, and shaked them as a waue of the Sea: mightie men hath it driuen from their houses, so that they wandred among strange nations.
\p
\v 19 A wicked man transgressing the commandements of the Lord, shall fall into suretiship: and hee that vndertaketh and followeth other mens businesse for gaine, shall fall into suits.
\p
\v 20 Helpe thy neighbour according to thy power, and beware that thou thy selfe fall not into the same.
\p
\v 21 The chiefe thing for life is water and bread, and clothing, and an house to couer shame.
\p
\v 22 Better is the life of a poore man in a meane cottage, then delicate fare in another mans house.
\p
\v 23 Be it little or much, holde thee contented, that thou heare not the reproch of thy house.
\p
\v 24 For it is a miserable life to goe from house to house: for where thou art a stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth.
\p
\v 25 Thou shalt entertaine and feast, and haue no thankes: moreouer, thou shalt heare bitter words.
\p
\v 26 Come thou stranger, and furnish a table, and feede me of that thou hast ready.
\p
\v 27 Giue place thou stranger to an honourable man, my brother commeth to be lodged, and I haue neede of mine house.
\p
\v 28 These things are grieuous to a man of vnderstanding: the vpbraiding of house-roome, and reproching of the lender.

\c 30
\p
\v 1 Hee that loueth his sonne, causeth him oft to feele the rodde, that hee may haue ioy of him in the end.
\p
\v 2 He that chastiseth his sonne, shall haue ioy in him, and shall reioyce of him among his acquaintance.
\p
\v 3 He that teacheth his sonne, grieueth the enemie: and before his friends he shall reioyce of him.
\p
\v 4 Though his father die, yet he is as though hee were not dead: for hee hath left one behinde him that is like himselfe.
\p
\v 5 While he liued, he saw and reioyced in him: and when he died hee was not sorrowfull.
\p
\v 6 He left behinde him an auenger against his enemies, and one that shall requite kindnesse to his friends.
\p
\v 7 He that maketh too much of his sonne, shall binde vp his wounds, and his bowels wil be troubled at euery cry.
\p
\v 8 An horse not broken becommeth headstrong: and a childe left to himselfe will be wilfull.
\p
\v 9 Cocker thy childe, and hee shall make thee afraid: play with him, and he will bring thee to heauinesse.
\p
\v 10 Laugh not with him, lest thou haue sorrow with him, and lest thou gnash thy teeth in the end.
\p
\v 11 Giue him no liberty in his youth, and winke not at his follies.
\p
\v 12 Bow downe his necke while hee is young, and beate him on the sides while he is a childe, lest hee waxe stubborne, and be disobedient vnto thee, and so bring sorrow to thine heart.
\p
\v 13 Chastise thy sonne, and hold him to labour, lest his lewd behauiour be an offence vnto thee.
\p
\v 14 Better is the poore being sound and strong of constitution, then a rich man that is afflicted in his body.
\p
\v 15 Health and good state of body are aboue all gold, and a strong body aboue infinite wealth.
\p
\v 16 There is no riches aboue a sound body, and no ioy aboue the ioy of the heart.
\p
\v 17 Death is better then a bitter life, or continuall sickenesse.
\p
\v 18 Delicates powred vpon a mouth shut vp, are as messes of meat set vpon a graue.
\p
\v 19 What good doth the offering vnto an idole? for neither can it eat nor smell: so is he that is persecuted of the Lord.
\p
\v 20 Hee seeth with his eyes and groneth, as an Eunuch that embraceth a virgine, and sigheth.
\p
\v 21 Giue not ouer thy mind to heauinesse, and afflict not thy selfe in thine owne counsell.
\p
\v 22 The gladnesse of the heart is the life of man, and the ioyfulnes of a man prolongeth his dayes.
\p
\v 23 Loue thine owne soule, and comfort thy heart, remoue sorrow far from thee: for sorrow hath killed many, and there is no profit therein.
\p
\v 24 Enuie and wrath shorten the life, and carefulnesse bringeth age before the time.
\p
\v 25 A cherefull and good heart will haue a care of his meat and diet.

\c 31
\p
\v 1 Watching for riches, consumeth the flesh, and the care therof driueth away sleepe.
\p
\v 2 Watching care will not let a man slumber, as a sore disease breaketh sleepe.
\p
\v 3 The rich hath great labour in gathering riches together, and when he resteth, he is filled with his delicates.
\p
\v 4 The poore laboureth in his poore estate, and when he leaueth off, hee is still needie.
\p
\v 5 He that loueth gold shall not bee iustified, and he that followeth corruption, shall haue enough thereof.
\p
\v 6 Gold hath bin the ruine of many, and their destruction was present.
\p
\v 7 It is a stumbling block vnto them that sacrifice vnto it, and euery foole shall be taken therewith.
\p
\v 8 Blessed is the rich that is found without blemish, and hath not gone after gold:
\p
\v 9 Who is he? and we will call him blessed: for wonderfull things hath hee done among his people.
\p
\v 10 Who hath bene tried thereby, and found perfit? then let him glory. Who might offend and hath not offended, or done euill, and hath not done it?
\p
\v 11 His goods shall be established, and the congregati&#333; shall declare his almes.
\p
\v 12 If thou sit at a bountifull table, bee not greedy vpon it, and say not, There is much meate on it.
\p
\v 13 Remember that a wicked eye is an euill thing: and what is created more wicked then an eye? therefore it weepeth vpon euery occasion.
\p
\v 14 Stretch not thine hand whithersoeuer it looketh, and thrust it not with him into the dish.
\p
\v 15 Iudge of thy neighbour by thy selfe: and be discreet in euery point.
\p
\v 16 Eate as it becommeth a man those things which are set before thee: and deuoure not, lest thou be hated.
\p
\v 17 Leaue off first for maners sake, and be not vnsatiable, lest thou offend.
\p
\v 18 When thou sittest among many, reach not thine hand out first of all.
\p
\v 19 A very litle is sufficient for a man well nurtured, and he fetcheth not his wind short vpon his bed.
\p
\v 20 Sound sleepe commeth of moderate eating: he riseth early, and his wits are with him, but the paine of watching and choller, and pangs of the bellie are with an vnsatiable man.
\p
\v 21 And if thou hast bin forced to eate, arise, goe forth, vomit, and thou shalt haue rest.
\p
\v 22 My sonne, heare me, and despise me not, and at the last thou shalt finde as I told thee: in all thy workes bee quicke, so shall there no sickenesse come vnto thee.
\p
\v 23 Who so is liberall of his meat, men shall speake well of him, and the report of his good housekeeping will be beleeued.
\p
\v 24 But against him that is a niggard of his meate, the whole citie shall murmure; and the testimonies of his niggardnesse shall not be doubted of.
\p
\v 25 Shew not thy valiantnesse in wine, for wine hath destroyed many.
\p
\v 26 The furnace prooueth the edge by dipping: so doth wine the hearts of the proud by drunkennesse.
\p
\v 27 Wine is as good as life to a man if it be drunke moderatly: what life is then to a man that is without wine? for it was made to make men glad.
\p
\v 28 Wine measurably drunke, and in season, bringeth gladnesse of the heart and cheerefulnesse of the minde.
\p
\v 29 But wine drunken with excesse, maketh bitternesse of the minde, with brawling and quarreling.
\p
\v 30 Drunkennesse increaseth the rage of a foole till he offend, it diminisheth strength, and maketh wounds.
\p
\v 31 Rebuke not thy neighbour at the wine, and despise him not in his mirth: giue him no despitefull words, and presse not vpon him with vrging him (to drinke.)

\c 32
\p
\v 1 If thou be made the master (of the feast) lift not thy selfe vp, but bee among them as one of the rest, take diligent care for them, and so sit downe.
\p
\v 2 And when thou hast done all thy office, take thy place that thou mayest be merry with them, and receiue a crowne for thy well ordering of the feast.
\p
\v 3 Speake thou that art the elder, for it becometh thee, but with sound iudgement, and hinder not musicke.
\p
\v 4 Powre not out words where there is a musitian, and shew not forth wisedome out of time.
\p
\v 5 A consort of musicke in a banket of wine, is as a signet of Carbuncle set in gold.
\p
\v 6 As a signet of an Emeraud set in a worke of gold, so is the melodie of musicke with pleasant wine.
\p
\v 7 Speake yong man, if there be need of thee: and yet scarsely when thou art twise asked:
\p
\v 8 Let thy speach be short, comprehending much in few words, be as one that knoweth, and yet holdeth his tongue.
\p
\v 9 If thou be among great men, make not thy selfe equall with them, and when ancient men are in place, vse not many words.
\p
\v 10 Before the thunder goeth lightening: and before a shamefast man shall goe fauour.
\p
\v 11 Rise vp betimes, and be not the last: but get thee home without delay.
\p
\v 12 There take thy pastime, & do what thou wilt: but sinne not by proud speach
\p
\v 13 And for these things blesse him that made thee, and hath replenished thee with his good things.
\p
\v 14 Who so feareth the Lord, will receiue his discipline, and they that seeke him early, shall find fauour.
\p
\v 15 He that seeketh the law, shall be filled therewith: but the hypocrite will be offended thereat.
\p
\v 16 They that feare the Lord shall find iudgement, and shall kindle iustice as a light.
\p
\v 17 A sinfull man will not be reproued, but findeth an excuse according to his will.
\p
\v 18 A man of counsell will be considerate, but a strange and proud man is not daunted with feare, euen when of himselfe he hath done without counsell.
\p
\v 19 Doe nothing without aduice, and when thou hast once done, repent not.
\p
\v 20 Goe not in a way wherein thou maiest fall, and stumble not among the stones.
\p
\v 21 Be not confident in a plaine way.
\p
\v 22 And beware of thine owne children.
\p
\v 23 In euery good worke trust thy owne soule: for this is the keeping of the commandements.
\p
\v 24 He that beleeueth in the Lord, taketh heed to the commandement, and he that trusted in him, shall fare neuer the worse.

\c 33
\p
\v 1 There shall no euill happen vnto him that feareth the Lord, but in temptation euen againe he will deliuer him.
\p
\v 2 A wise man hateth not the Law, but he that is an hypocrite therein, is as a ship in a storme.
\p
\v 3 A man of vnderstanding trusteth in the Law, and the Law is faithfull vnto him, as an oracle.
\p
\v 4 Prepare what to say, and so thou shalt be heard, and binde vp instruction, and then make answere.
\p
\v 5 The heart of the foolish is like a cartwheele: and his thoughts are like a rolling axeltree.
\p
\v 6 A stallion horse is as a mocking friend, hee neigheth vnder euery one that sitteth vpon him.
\p
\v 7 Why doth one day excell another? when as all the light of euery day in the yeere is of the Sunne.
\p
\v 8 By the knowledge of the Lord they were distinguished: and he altered seasons and feasts.
\p
\v 9 Some of them hath hee made high dayes, and hallowed them, and some of them hath hee made ordinary dayes.
\p
\v 10 And all men are from the ground, and Adam was created of earth.
\p
\v 11 In much knowledge the Lord hath diuided them, and made their wayes diuers.
\p
\v 12 Some of them hath hee blessed, and exalted, and some of them hath hee sanctified, and set neere himselfe: but some of them hath hee cursed, and brought low, and turned out of their places.
\p
\v 13 As the clay is in the potters hand to fashion it at his pleasure: so man is in the hand of him that made him, to render to them as liketh him best.
\p
\v 14 Good is set against euill, and life against death: so is the godly against the sinner, and the sinner against the godly.
\p
\v 15 So looke vpon all the workes of the most High, and there are two and two, one against another.
\p
\v 16 I awaked vp last of all, as one that gathereth after the grape-gatherers: by the blessing of the Lord I profited, and filled my wine-presse, like a gatherer of grapes.
\p
\v 17 Consider that I laboured not for my selfe onely, but for all them that seeke learning;
\p
\v 18 Heare me, O ye great men of the people, and hearken with your eares ye rulers of the Congregation:
\p
\v 19 Giue not thy sonne, and wife, thy brother and friend power ouer thee while thou liuest, and giue not thy goods to another, lest it repent thee: and thou intreat for the same againe.
\p
\v 20 As long as thou liuest and hast breath in thee, giue not thy selfe ouer to any.
\p
\v 21 For better it is that thy children should seeke to thee, then that thou shouldst stand to their courtesie.
\p
\v 22 In all thy workes keepe to thy selfe the preheminence, leaue not a staine in thine honour.
\p
\v 23 At the time when thou shalt end thy dayes, and finish thy life, distribute thine inheritance.
\p
\v 24 Fodder, a wand, and burdens, are for the asse: and bread, correction, and worke for a seruant.
\p
\v 25 If thou set thy seruant to labour, thou shalt finde rest: but if thou let him goe idle, he shall seeke libertie.
\p
\v 26 A yoke and a collar doe bow the necke: so are tortures and torments for an euill seruant.
\p
\v 27 Sende him to labour that hee be not idle: for idlenesse teacheth much euill.
\p
\v 28 Set him to worke, as is fit for him; if he be not obedient, put on more heauy fetters.
\p
\v 29 But be not excessiue toward any, and without discretion doe nothing.
\p
\v 30 If thou haue a seruant, let him bee vnto thee as thy selfe, because thou hast bought him with a price.
\p
\v 31 If thou haue a seruant, intreate him as a brother: for thou hast neede of him, as of thine owne soule: if thou intreate him euill, and he runne from thee, which way wilt thou goe to seeke him?

\c 34
\p
\v 1 The hopes of a man voyd of vnderstanding are vaine, and false: and dreames lift vp fooles.
\p
\v 2 Who so regardeth dreames, is like him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the winde.
\p
\v 3 The vision of dreames is the resemblance of one thing to another, euen as the likenesse of a face to a face.
\p
\v 4 Of an vncleane thing, what can be cleansed? and from that thing which is false, what trueth can come?
\p
\v 5 Diuinations, and soothsayings, and dreames are vaine: and the heart fancieth as a womans heart in trauell.
\p
\v 6 If they be not sent from the most high in thy visitation, set not thy heart vpon them.
\p
\v 7 For dreames haue deceiued many, and they haue failed that put their trust in them.
\p
\v 8 The Law shall be found perfect without lies: and wisedome is perfection to a faithfull mouth.
\p
\v 9 A man that hath trauailed knoweth many things: and hee that hath much experience, wil declare wisedome.
\p
\v 10 He that hath no experience, knoweth little: but he that hath trauailed, is full of prudence.
\p
\v 11 When I trauailed, I saw many things: and I vnderstand more, then I can expresse.
\p
\v 12 I was oft times in danger of death, yet I was deliuered because of these things.
\p
\v 13 The spirit of those that feare the Lord shall liue, for their hope is in him that saueth them.
\p
\v 14 Who so feareth the Lord, shall not feare nor be afraid, for hee is his hope.
\p
\v 15 Blessed is the soule of him that feareth the Lord: to whom doeth hee looke? and who is his strength?
\p
\v 16 For the eyes of the Lord are vpon them that loue him, he is their mightie protection, and strong stay, a defence from heat, and a couer from the Sunne at noone, a preseruation from stumbling, and a helpe from falling.
\p
\v 17 He raiseth vp the soule, and lighteneth the eyes: hee giueth health, life, and blessing.
\p
\v 18 Hee that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, his offering is ridiculous, and the giftes of vniust men are not accepted.
\p
\v 19 The most high is not pleased with the offerings of the wicked, neither is he pacified for sinne by the multitude of sacrifices.
\p
\v 20 Who so bringeth an offering of the goods of the poore, doeth as one that killeth the sonne before his fathers eyes.
\p
\v 21 The bread of the needie, is their life: he that defraudeth him thereof, is a man of blood.
\p
\v 22 Hee that taketh away his neighbours liuing, slayeth him: and hee that defraudeth the labourer of his hire, is a bloodshedder.
\p
\v 23 When one buildeth, and another pulleth downe, what profite haue they then but labour?
\p
\v 24 When one prayeth, and another curseth, whose voice will the Lorde heare?
\p
\v 25 He that washeth himselfe after the touching of a dead body, if he touch it againe, what auaileth his washing?
\p
\v 26 So is it with a man that fasteth for his sinnes, and goeth againe and doeth the same: who will heare his prayer, or what doeth his humbling profit him?

\c 35
\p
\v 1 Hee that keepeth the law, bringeth offerings enow: he that taketh heed to the commandement, offereth a peace offering.
\p
\v 2 He that requiteth a good turne, offereth fine floure: and he that giueth almes, sacrificeth praise.
\p
\v 3 To depart from wickednesse is a thing pleasing to the Lord: and to forsake vnrighteousnesse, is a propitiation.
\p
\v 4 Thou shalt not appeare emptie before the Lord:
\p
\v 5 For all these things are to bee done because of the commandement.
\p
\v 6 The offering of the righteous maketh the Altar fat, and the sweete sauour thereof is before the most high.
\p
\v 7 The sacrifice of a iust man is acceptable, and the memoriall thereof shall neuer be forgotten.
\p
\v 8 Giue the Lord his honour with a good eye, and diminish not the first fruits of thine hands.
\p
\v 9 In all thy gifts shew a cheerefull countenance, and dedicate thy tithes with gladnesse.
\p
\v 10 Giue vnto the most high, according as hee hath enriched thee, and as thou hast gotten, giue with a cheerefull eye.
\p
\v 11 For the Lord recompenseth, and will giue thee seuen times as much.
\p
\v 12 Doe not thinke to corrupt with gifts, for such he will not receiue: and trust not to vnrighteous sacrifices, for the Lord is iudge, and with him is no respect of persons.
\p
\v 13 Hee will not accept any person against a poore man: but will heare the prayer of the oppressed.
\p
\v 14 He will not despise the supplication of the fatherlesse: nor the widowe when she powreth out her complaint.
\p
\v 15 Doeth not the teares run downe the widowes cheeks? and is not her crie against him that causeth them to fall?
\p
\v 16 He that serueth the Lord, shall be accepted with fauour, and his prayer shall reach vnto the cloudes.
\p
\v 17 The prayer of the humble pierceth the clouds: and till it come nigh he will not be comforted: and will not depart till the most High shall beholde to iudge righteously, and execute iudgement.
\p
\v 18 For the Lord wil not be slacke, neither will the mightie be patient towards them, till he hath smitten in sunder the loines of the vnmercifull, and repaid vengeance to the heathen: till he haue taken away the multitude of the proud, and broken the scepter of the vnrighteous:
\p
\v 19 Till he haue rendred to euery man according to his deeds, and to the works of men according to their deuises, till he haue iudged the cause of his people: and made them to reioyce in his mercie,
\p
\v 20 Mercie is seasonable in the time of affliction, as cloudes of raine in the time of drought.

\c 36
\p
\v 1 Haue mercie vpon vs, O Lord God of all, and behold vs:
\p
\v 2 And send thy feare vpon all the nations that seeke not after thee.
\p
\v 3 Lift vp thy hand against the strange nations, and let them see thy power.
\p
\v 4 As thou wast sanctified in vs before them: so be thou magnified among them before vs.
\p
\v 5 And let them know thee, as we haue knowen thee, that there is no God, but onely thou, O God.
\p
\v 6 Shew new signes, and make other strange wonders: glorifie thy hand and thy right arme, that they may set forth thy wonderous workes.
\p
\v 7 Raise vp indignation, and powre out wrath: take away the aduersarie and destroy the enemie.
\p
\v 8 Make the time short, remember the couenant, and let them declare thy wonderfull works.
\p
\v 9 Let him that escapeth, be consumed by the rage of the fire, and let them perish that oppresse the people.
\p
\v 10 Smite in sunder the heads of the rulers of the heathen, that say, There is none other but we.
\p
\v 11 Gather all the tribes of Iacob together, and inherit thou them, as from the beginning.
\p
\v 12 O Lord haue mercie vpon the people, that is called by thy name, and vpon Israel, whom thou hast named thy first borne.
\p
\v 13 O bee mercifull vnto Ierusalem thy holy citie, the place of thy rest.
\p
\v 14 Fill Sion with thine vnspeakable oracles, and thy people with thy glory.
\p
\v 15 Giue testimonie vnto those that thou hast possessed from the beginning, and raise vp prophets that haue bin in thy name.
\p
\v 16 Reward them that wait for thee, and let thy prophets be found faithfull.
\p
\v 17 O Lord heare the prayer of thy seruants, according to the blessing of Aaron ouer thy people, that all they which dwel vpon the earth, may know that thou art the Lord, the eternall God.
\p
\v 18 The belly deuoureth all meates, yet is one meat better then another.
\p
\v 19 As the palate tasteth diuers kinds of venison: so doth an heart of vnderstanding false speeches.
\p
\v 20 A froward heart causeth heauinesse: but a man of experience will recompense him.
\p
\v 21 A woman will receiue euery man, yet is one daughter better then another
\p
\v 22 The beautie of a woman cheareth the countenance, and a man loueth nothing better.
\p
\v 23 If there be kindnesse, meekenes, and comfort in her tongue, then is not her husband like other men.
\p
\v 24 He that getteth a wife, beginneth a possession, a helpe like vnto himselfe, and a pillar of rest.
\p
\v 25 Where no hedge is, there the possession is spoiled: and he that hath no wife will wander vp and downe mourning.
\p
\v 26 Who will trust a thiefe well appointed, that skippeth from citie to citie? so who will beleeue a man that hath no house? and lodgeth wheresoeuer the night taketh him?

\c 37
\p
\v 1 Euery friend saieth, I am his friend also: but there is a friend which is onely a friend in name.
\p
\v 2 Is it not a griefe vnto death, when a companion and friend is turned to an enemie?
\p
\v 3 O wicked imagination, whence camest thou in to couer the earth with deceit?
\p
\v 4 There is a companion, which reioyceth in the prosperity of a friend: but in the time of trouble will be against him.
\p
\v 5 There is a companion which helpeth his friend for the belly, and taketh vp the buckler against the enemie.
\p
\v 6 Forget not thy friend in thy minde, and be not vnmindfull of him in thy riches.
\p
\v 7 Euery counseller extolleth counsell; but there is some that counselleth for himselfe.
\p
\v 8 Beware of a counseller, and know before what neede he hath (for he will counsell for himselfe) lest hee cast the lot vpon thee:
\p
\v 9 And say vnto thee, Thy way is good: and afterward he stand on the other side, to see what shall befall thee.
\p
\v 10 Consult not with one that suspecteth thee: and hide thy counsell from such as enuie thee.
\p
\v 11 Neither consult with a woman touching her of whom she is iealous; neither with a coward in matters of warre, nor with a merchant concerning exchange; nor with a buyer of selling; nor with an enuious man of thankfulnesse; nor with an vnmercifull man touching kindnesse; nor with the slouthfull for any worke; nor with an hireling for a yeere, of finishing worke; nor with an idle seruant of much businesse: Hearken not vnto these in any matter of counsell.
\p
\v 12 But be continually with a godly man, whom thou knowest to keepe the commandements of the Lord, whose minde is according to thy minde, and will sorrow with thee, if thou shalt miscarry.
\p
\v 13 And let the counsell of thine owne heart stand: for there is no man more faithfull vnto thee then it.
\p
\v 14 For a mans minde is sometime wont to tell him more then seuen watchmen, that sit aboue in an high towre.
\p
\v 15 And aboue all this pray to the most high, that he will direct thy way in trueth.
\p
\v 16 Let reason goe before euery enterprise, & counsell before euery action.
\p
\v 17 The countenance is a signe of changing of the heart.
\p
\v 18 Foure maner of things appeare: good and euill, life and death: but the tongue ruleth ouer them continually.
\p
\v 19 There is one that is wise and teacheth many, and yet is vnprofitable to himselfe.
\p
\v 20 There is one that sheweth wisedome in words, and is hated: he shall be destitute of all foode.
\p
\v 21 For grace is not giuen him from the Lord: because he is depriued of all wisedome.
\p
\v 22 Another is wise to himselfe: and the fruits of vnderstanding are commendable in his mouth.
\p
\v 23 A wise man instructeth his people, and the fruits of his vnderstanding faile not.
\p
\v 24 A wise man shall be filled with blessing, and all they that see him, shall count him happy.
\p
\v 25 The daies of the life of man may be numbred: but the daies of Israel are innumerable.
\p
\v 26 A wise man shall inherite glory among his people, and his name shalbe perpetuall.
\p
\v 27 My sonne prooue thy soule in thy life, and see what is euill for it, and giue not that vnto it.
\p
\v 28 For all things are not profitable for all men, neither hath euery soule pleasure in euery thing.
\p
\v 29 Be not vnsatiable in any dainty thing: nor too greedy vpon meates.
\p
\v 30 For excesse of meates, bringeth sicknesse, and surfetting will turne into choler.
\p
\v 31 By surfetting haue many perished, but hee that taketh heed, prolongeth his life.

\c 38
\p
\v 1 Honour a Phisitian with the honour due vnto him, for the vses which you may haue of him: for the Lord hath created him.
\p
\v 2 For of the most High commeth healing, and he shall receiue honour of the King.
\p
\v 3 The skill of the Phisitian shall lift vp his head: and in the sight of great men he shalbe in admiration.
\p
\v 4 The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth; and he that is wise will not abhorre them.
\p
\v 5 Was not the water made sweet with wood, that the vertue thereof might be knowen?
\p
\v 6 And he hath giuen men skill, that hee might be honoured in his marueilous workes.
\p
\v 7 With such doeth he heale men, and taketh away their paines.
\p
\v 8 Of such doeth the Apothecarie make a confection; and of his workes there is no end, and from him is peace ouer all the earth.
\p
\v 9 My sonne, in thy sickenesse be not negligent: but pray vnto the Lord, and he will make thee whole.
\p
\v 10 Leaue off from sinne, and order thy hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from all wickednesse.
\p
\v 11 Giue a sweet sauour, and a memoriall of fine flowre: and make a fat offering, as not being.
\p
\v 12 Then giue place to the phisitian, for the Lord hath created him: let him not go from thee, for thou hast need of him.
\p
\v 13 There is a time when in their hands there is good successe.
\p
\v 14 For they shall also pray vnto the Lord, that hee would prosper that, which they giue, for ease and remedy to prolong life.
\p
\v 15 He that sinneth before his maker, let him fal into the hand of the Phisitian.
\p
\v 16 My sonne, let teares fall downe ouer the dead, and begin to lament, as if thou hadst suffered great harme thy selfe: and then couer his body according to the custome, & neglect not his buriall.
\p
\v 17 Weepe bitterly, and make great moane, and vse lamentation, as hee is worthy, and that a day or two, lest thou be euill spoken of: and then comfort thy selfe for thy heauinesse.
\p
\v 18 For of heauinesse commeth death, and the heauinesse of the heart, breaketh strength.
\p
\v 19 In affliction also sorrow remaineth: and the life of the poore, is the curse of the heart.
\p
\v 20 Take no heauines to heart: driue it away, and remember the last end.
\p
\v 21 Forget it not, for there is no turning againe: thou shalt not doe him good, but hurt thy selfe.
\p
\v 22 Remember my iudgement: for thine also shall be so; yesterday for me, and to day for thee.
\p
\v 23 When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest, & be comforted for him, when his spirit is departed from him.
\p
\v 24 The wisedome of a learned man c&#333;meth by opportunitie of leasure: & he that hath litle busines shal become wise.
\p
\v 25 How can he get wisdome that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the goad; that driueth oxen, and is occupied in their labours, and whose talke is of bullocks?
\p
\v 26 He giueth his minde to make furrowes: and is diligent to giue the kine fodder.
\p
\v 27 So euery carpenter, and workemaster, that laboureth night and day: and they that cut and graue seales, and are diligent to make great variety, and giue themselues to counterfait imagerie, and watch to finish a worke.
\p
\v 28 The smith also sitting by the anuill, & considering the iron worke; the vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh, and he fighteth with the heat of the furnace: the noise of the hammer & the anuill is euer in his eares, and his eies looke still vpon the patterne of the thing that he maketh, he setteth his mind to finish his worke, & watcheth to polish it perfitly.
\p
\v 29 So doeth the potter sitting at his worke, and turning the wheele about with his feet, who is alway carefully set at his worke: and maketh all his worke by number.
\p
\v 30 He fashioneth the clay with his arme, and boweth downe his strength before his feet: he applieth himselfe to lead it ouer; and he is diligent to make cleane the furnace.
\p
\v 31 All these trust to their hands: and euery one is wise in his worke.
\p
\v 32 Without these cannot a citie be inhabited: and they shall not dwell where they will, nor goe vp and downe.
\p
\v 33 They shall not be sought for in publike counsaile; nor sit high in the congregation: they shal not sit on the Iudges seate, nor vnderstand the sentence of iudgement: they cannot declare iustice, and iudgement, and they shall not be found where parables are spoken.
\p
\v 34 But they will maintaine the state of the world, and all their desire is in the worke of their craft.

\c 39
\p
\v 1 But hee that giueth his minde to the Law of the most high, and is occupied in the meditation thereof, wil seeke out the wisdome of all the ancient, and be occupied in prophecies.
\p
\v 2 Hee will keepe the sayings of the renowmed men: and where subtile parables are, he will be there also.
\p
\v 3 Hee will seeke out the secrets of graue sentences, and be conuersant in darke parables.
\p
\v 4 He shall serue among great men, and appeare before princes: he will trauaile through strange countreys, for hee hath tried the good, and the euill among men.
\p
\v 5 Hee will giue his heart to resort early to the Lord that made him, and will pray before the most high, and will open his mouth in prayer, and make supplication for his sinnes.
\p
\v 6 When the great Lord will, he shall bee filled with the spirit of vnderstanding: he shal powre out wise sentences, and giue thankes vnto the Lord in his prayer.
\p
\v 7 Hee shall direct his counsell and knowledge, and in his secrets shall hee meditate.
\p
\v 8 Hee shall shew foorth that which he hath learned, and shall glory in the Law of the couenant of the Lord.
\p
\v 9 Many shall commend his vnderstanding, and so long as the world endureth, it shall not be blotted out, his memoriall shall not depart away, and his name shall liue from generation to generation.
\p
\v 10 Nations shall shewe foorth his wisedome, and the congregation shall declare his praise.
\p
\v 11 If hee die, he shall leaue a greater name then a thousand: and if he liue, he shall increase it.
\p
\v 12 Yet I haue more to say which I haue thought vpon, for I am filled as the Moone at the full.
\p
\v 13 Hearken vnto me, ye holy children, and budde foorth as a rose growing by the brooke of the field:
\p
\v 14 And giue yee a sweete sauour as frankincense, and flourish as a lilly, send foorth a smell, and sing a song of praise, blesse the Lord in all his workes.
\p
\v 15 Magnifie his Name, and shewe foorth his praise with the songs of your lips, and with harpes, and in praising him you shall say after this maner:
\p
\v 16 Al the works of the Lord are exceeding good, & whatsoeuer hee commandeth, shalbe accomplished in due season.
\p
\v 17 And none may say, What is this? wherefore is that? for at time conuenient they shall all be sought out: at his commaundement the waters stood as an heape, & at the wordes of his mouth the receptacles of waters.
\p
\v 18 At his commandement is done whatsoeuer pleaseth him, and none can hinder when he will saue.
\p
\v 19 The workes of all flesh are before him, & nothing can be hid from his eyes.
\p
\v 20 He seeth from euerlasting to euerlasting, and there is nothing wonderfull before him.
\p
\v 21 A man neede not to say, What is this? wherefore is that? for hee hath made all things for their vses.
\p
\v 22 His blessing couered the dry land as a riuer, and watered it as a flood.
\p
\v 23 As hee hath turned the waters into saltnesse: so shall the heathen inherite his wrath.
\p
\v 24 As his wayes are plaine vnto the holy, so are they stumbling blockes vnto the wicked.
\p
\v 25 For the good, are good things created from the beginning: so euill things for sinners.
\p
\v 26 The principall things for the whole vse of mans life, are water, fire, yron, and salt, floure of wheate, honie, milke, and the blood of the grape, and oyle, and clothing.
\p
\v 27 All these things are for good to the godly: so to the sinners they are turned into euill.
\p
\v 28 There be spirits that are created for vengeance, which in their furie lay on sore strokes, in the time of destruction they powre out their force, and appease the wrath of him that made them.
\p
\v 29 Fire, and haile, and famine, and death: all these were created for vengeance:
\p
\v 30 Teeth of wild beasts, and scorpions, serpents, & the sword, punishing the wicked to destruction.
\p
\v 31 They shall reioice in his commandement, and they shall bee ready vpon earth when neede is, and when their time is come, they shall not transgresse his word.
\p
\v 32 Therefore from the beginning I was resolued, and thought vpon these things, and haue left them in writing.
\p
\v 33 All the workes of the Lord are good: and he will giue euery needefull thing in due season.
\p
\v 34 So that a man cannot say, This is worse then that: for in time they shall all be well approued.
\p
\v 35 And therefore praise ye the Lord with the whole heart and mouth, and blesse the Name of the Lord.

\c 40
\p
\v 1 Great trauaile is created for euery man, and an heauy yoke is vpon the sons of Adam, from the day that they goe out of their mothers wombe, till the day that they returne to the mother of all things.
\p
\v 2 Their imagination of things to come, & the day of death trouble their thoughts, and cause feare of heart:
\p
\v 3 From him that sitteth on a throne of glory, vnto him that is humbled in earth and ashes.
\p
\v 4 From him that weareth purple, and a crown, vnto him that is clothed with a linnen frocke.
\p
\v 5 Wrath, and enuie, trouble and vnquietnesse, feare of death, and anger, and strife, and in the time of rest vpon his bed, his night sleepe doe change his knowledge.
\p
\v 6 A litle or nothing is his rest, and afterward he is in his sleepe, as in a day of keeping watch, troubled in the vision of his heart, as if he were escaped out of a battell:
\p
\v 7 When all is safe, he awaketh, and marueileth that the feare was nothing.
\p
\v 8 Such things happen vnto all flesh, both man and beast, and that is seuen fold more vpon sinners.
\p
\v 9 Death and bloodshed, strife and sword, calamities, famine, tribulation, and the scourge:
\p
\v 10 These things are created for the wicked, and for their sakes came the flood.
\p
\v 11 All things that are of the earth shal turne to the earth againe: and that which is of the waters doeth returne into the Sea.
\p
\v 12 All briberie and iniustice shall be blotted out: but true dealing shall endure for euer.
\p
\v 13 The goods of the vniust shall bee dried vp like a riuer, and shall vanish with noise, like a great thunder in raine.
\p
\v 14 While he openeth his hand he shal reioyce: so shall transgressours come to nought.
\p
\v 15 The children of the vngodly shall not bring forth many branches: but are as vncleane roots vpon a hard rocke.
\p
\v 16 The weed growing vpon euery water, and banke of a riuer, shall bee pulled vp before all grasse.
\p
\v 17 Bountifulnes is as a most fruitfull garden, and mercifulnesse endureth for euer.
\p
\v 18 To labour & to be content with that a man hath, is a sweet life: but hee that findeth a treasure, is aboue them both.
\p
\v 19 Children and the building of a citie continue a mans name: but a blamelesse wife is counted aboue them both.
\p
\v 20 Wine & musicke reioyce the heart: but the loue of wisedome is aboue them both.
\p
\v 21 The pipe and the psalterie make sweet melodie: but a pleasant tongue is aboue them both.
\p
\v 22 Thine eye desireth fauour and beautie: but more then both, corne while it is greene.
\p
\v 23 A friend and companion neuer meet amisse: but aboue both is a wife with her husband.
\p
\v 24 Brethren and helpe are against time of trouble: but almes shall deliuer more then them both.
\p
\v 25 Golde and siluer make the foote stand sure: but counsell is esteemed aboue them both.
\p
\v 26 Riches and strength lift vp the heart: but the feare of the Lord is aboue them both: there is no want in the feare of the Lord, and it needeth not to seeke helpe.
\p
\v 27 The feare of the Lord is a fruitfull garden, and couereth him aboue all glory.
\p
\v 28 My sonne, lead not a beggers life: for better it is to die then to beg.
\p
\v 29 The life of him that dependeth on another mans table, is not to be counted for a life: for he polluteth himselfe with other mens meate, but a wise man well nurtured will beware thereof.
\p
\v 30 Begging is sweet in the mouth of the shamelesse: but in his belly there shall burne a fire.

\c 41
\p
\v 1 O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that liueth at rest in his possessions, vnto the man that hath nothing to vexe him, and that hath prosperity in all things: yea vnto him that is yet able to receiue meate?
\p
\v 2 O death, acceptable is thy sentence vnto the needy, and vnto him whose strength faileth, that is now in the last age, and is vexed with all things, and to him that despaireth and hath lost patience.
\p
\v 3 Feare not the sentence of death, remember them that haue beene before thee, and that come after, for this is the sentence of the Lord ouer all flesh.
\p
\v 4 And why art thou against the pleasure of the most High? there is no inquisition in the graue, whether thou haue liued ten, or a hundred, or a thousand yeeres.
\p
\v 5 The children of sinners, are abhominable children: and they that are conuersant in the dwelling of the vngodly.
\p
\v 6 The inheritance of sinners children shal perish, and their posterity shal haue a perpetuall reproch.
\p
\v 7 The children will complaine of an vngodly father, because they shall be reproched for his sake.
\p
\v 8 Woe be vnto you vngodly men which haue forsaken the law of the most high God: for if you encrease, it shall be to your destruction.
\p
\v 9 And if you be borne, you shall be borne to a curse: and if you die, a curse shall be your portion.
\p
\v 10 All that are of the earth shall turne to earth againe: so the vngodly shall goe from a curse to destruction.
\p
\v 11 The mourning of men is about their bodies: but an ill name of sinners shall be blotted out.
\p
\v 12 Haue regard to thy name: for that shall continue with thee aboue a thousand great treasures of gold.
\p
\v 13 A good life hath but few daies: but a good name endureth for euer.
\p
\v 14 My children, keepe discipline in peace: for wisedome that is hid, and a treasure that is not seene, what profit is in them both?
\p
\v 15 A man that hideth his foolishnesse is better then a man that hideth his wisedome.
\p
\v 16 Therefore be shamefast according to my word: for it is not good to retaine all shamefastnesse, neither is it altogether approoued in euery thing.
\p
\v 17 Be ashamed of whoredome before father and mother, and of a lie before a prince and a mighty man:
\p
\v 18 Of an offence before a iudge and ruler, of iniquitie before a congregation and people, of vniust dealing before thy partner and friend:
\p
\v 19 And of theft in regard of the place where thou soiournest, and in regard of the trueth of God and his couenant, and to leane with thine elbow vpon the meate, and of scorning to giue and take:
\p
\v 20 And of silence before them that salute thee, and to look vpon an harlot:
\p
\v 21 And to turne away thy face from thy kinsman, or to take away a portion or a gift, or to gaze vpon another mans wife,
\p
\v 22 Or to bee ouerbusie with his maide, and come not neere her bed, or of vpbraiding speaches before friends; and after thou hast giuen, vpbraide not:
\p
\v 23 Or of iterating and speaking againe that which thou hast heard, and of reuealing of secrets.
\p
\v 24 So shalt thou be truely shamefast, and finde fauour before all men.

\c 42
\p
\v 1 Of these things be not thou ashamed, and accept no person to sinne thereby.
\p
\v 2 Of the Law of the most High, and his Couenant, and of iudgement to iustifie the vngodly:
\p
\v 3 Of reckoning with thy partners, and traueilers: or of the gift of the heritage of friends:
\p
\v 4 Of exactnesse of ballance, and waights: or of getting much or little:
\p
\v 5 And of merchants indifferent selling, of much correction of children, and to make the side of an euill seruant to bleed.
\p
\v 6 Sure keeping is good where an euill wife is, and shut vp where many hands are.
\p
\v 7 Deliuer all things in number and waight, and put al in writing that thou giuest out, or receiuest in.
\p
\v 8 Be not ashamed to informe the vnwise and foolish, and the extreeme aged that contendeth with those that are yong, thus shalt thou bee truely learned and approued of all men liuing.
\p
\v 9 The father waketh for the daughter when no man knoweth, and the care for her taketh away sleepe; when shee is yong lest shee passe away the flowre of her age, and being married, lest she should be hated:
\p
\v 10 In her virginitie lest she should be defiled, and gotten with childe in her fathers house; and hauing an husband, lest she should misbehaue herselfe: and when shee is married, lest shee should be barren.
\p
\v 11 Keepe a sure watch ouer a shamelesse daughter, lest shee make thee a laughing stocke to thine enemies, and a by-word in the citie, and a reproch among the people, and make thee ashamed before the multitude.
\p
\v 12 Behold not euery bodies beauty, and sit not in the midst of women.
\p
\v 13 For from garments commeth a moth, and from women wickednesse.
\p
\v 14 Better is the churlishnesse of a man, then a courteous woman, a woman I say, which bringeth shame and reproch.
\p
\v 15 I will now remember the works of the Lord, and declare the things that I haue seene: in the words of the Lord are his workes.
\p
\v 16 The Sunne that giueth light, looketh vpon all things: and the worke thereof is full of the glory of the Lord.
\p
\v 17 The Lord hath not giuen power to the Saints to declare all his marueilous workes, which the Almightie Lord firmely setled, that whatsoeuer is, might be established for his glory.
\p
\v 18 He seeketh out the deepe and the heart, and considereth their crafty deuices: for the Lord knoweth all that may be knowen, and he beholdeth the signes of the world.
\p
\v 19 Hee declareth the things that are past, and for to come, and reueileth the steps of hidden things.
\p
\v 20 No thought escapeth him, neither any word is hidden from him.
\p
\v 21 Hee hath garnished the excellent workes of his wisedome, and hee is from euerlasting to euerlasting, vnto him may nothing be added, neither can he be diminished, and he hath no need of any counseller.
\p
\v 22 O how desireable are all his workes: and that a man may see euen to a sparke.
\p
\v 23 All these things liue and remaine for euer, for all vses, and they are all obedient.
\p
\v 24 All things are double one against another: and hee hath made nothing vnperfit.
\p
\v 25 One thing establisheth the good of another: and who shalbe filled with beholding his glory?

\c 43
\p
\v 1 The pride of the height, the cleare firmament, the beautie of heauen, with his glorious shew;
\p
\v 2 The Sunne when it appeareth, declaring at his rising, a marueilous instrument, the worke of the most High.
\p
\v 3 At noone it parcheth the country, and who can abide the burning heate thereof?
\p
\v 4 A man blowing a furnace is in works of heat, but the Sunne burneth the mountaines three times more; breathing out fiery vapours, and sending foorth bright beames, it dimmeth the eyes.
\p
\v 5 Great is the Lord that made it, and at his commandement it runneth hastily.
\p
\v 6 He made the Moone also to serue in her season, for a declaration of times, and a signe of the world.
\p
\v 7 From the Moone is the signe of Feasts, a light that decreaseth in her perfection.
\p
\v 8 The moneth is called after her name, encreasing wonderfully in her changing, being an instrument of the armies aboue, shining in the firmament of heauen,
\p
\v 9 The beautie of heauen, the glory of the starres, an ornament giuing light in the highest places of the Lord.
\p
\v 10 At the commandement of the holy One, they will stand in their order, and neuer faint in their watches.
\p
\v 11 Looke vpon the rainebow, and praise him that made it, very beautifull it is in the brightnesse thereof.
\p
\v 12 It compasseth the heauen about with a glorious circle, and the hands of the most high haue bended it.
\p
\v 13 By his commandement hee maketh the snow to fall apace, and sendeth swiftly the lightnings of his iudgment.
\p
\v 14 Through this the treasures are opened, and clouds flie forth as foules.
\p
\v 15 By his great power hee maketh the cloudes firme, and the hailestones are broken small.
\p
\v 16 At his sight the mountaines are shaken, and at his will the South wind bloweth.
\p
\v 17 The noise of the thunder maketh the earth to tremble: so doth the Northren storme, and the whirlewinde: as birds flying he scattereth the snow, and the falling downe thereof, is as the lighting of grashoppers.
\p
\v 18 The eye marueileth at the beauty of the whitenesse thereof, and the heart is astonished at the raining of it.
\p
\v 19 The hoare frost also as salt hee powreth on the earth, and being congealed, it lieth on the toppe of sharpe stakes.
\p
\v 20 Wheu the colde North-winde bloweth, and the water is congealed into yce, it abideth vpon euery gathering together of water, and clotheth the water as with a brestplate.
\p
\v 21 It deuoureth the mountaines, and burneth the wildernesse, and consumeth the grasse as fire.
\p
\v 22 A present remedy of all is a miste comming speedily: a dew comming after heate, refresheth.
\p
\v 23 By his counsell he appeaseth the deepe, and planteth Ilands therein.
\p
\v 24 They that saile on the Sea, tell of the danger thereof, and when wee heare it with our eares, wee marueile thereat.
\p
\v 25 For therein be strange and wonderous workes, varietie of all kindes of beasts, and whales created.
\p
\v 26 By him the ende of them hath prosperous successe, and by his word all things consist.
\p
\v 27 We may speake much, & yet come short: wherefore in summe, he is all.
\p
\v 28 How shall wee be able to magnifie him? for hee is great aboue all his workes.
\p
\v 29 The Lord is terrible and very great, and marueilous is his power.
\p
\v 30 When you glorifie the Lord exalt him as much as you can: for euen yet wil he farre exceed, and when you exalt him, put foorth all your strength, and be not weary: for you can neuer goe farre enough.
\p
\v 31 Who hath seene him, that hee might tell vs? and who can magnifie him as he is?
\p
\v 32 There are yet hid greater things then these be, for wee haue seene but a few of his workes:
\p
\v 33 For the Lord hath made all things, and to the godly hath hee giuen wisedome.

\c 44
\p
\v 1 Let vs now praise famous men, and our Fathers that begat vs.
\p
\v 2 The Lorde hath wrought great glory by them, through his great power from the beginning.
\p
\v 3 Such as did beare rule in their kingdomes, men renowmed for their power, giuing counsell by their vnderstanding, and declaring prophecies:
\p
\v 4 Leaders of the people by their counsels, and learning meet for the people, wise and eloquent in their instructions.
\p
\v 5 Such as found out musical tunes, and reiected verses in writing.
\p
\v 6 Rich men furnished with abilitie, liuing peaceably in their habitations.
\p
\v 7 All these were honoured in their generations, and were the glory of their times.
\p
\v 8 There be of them, that haue left a name behind them, that their praises might be reported.
\p
\v 9 And some there be, which haue no memorial, who are perished as though they had neuer bene, and are become as though they had neuer bene borne, and their children after them.
\p
\v 10 But these were mercifull men, whose righteousnesse hath not beene forgotten.
\p
\v 11 With their seed shall continually remaine a good inheritance, and their children are within the couenant.
\p
\v 12 Their seed stands fast, and their children for their sakes.
\p
\v 13 Their seed shall remaine for euer, and their glory shall not be blotted out.
\p
\v 14 Their bodies are buried in peace, but their name liueth for euermore.
\p
\v 15 The people will tell of their wisdome, and the congregation will shew forth their praise.
\p
\v 16 Enoch pleased the Lord, and was translated, being an example of repentance, to all generations.
\p
\v 17 Noah was found perfect and righteous, in the time of wrath, he was taken in exchange (for the world) therefore was he left as a remnant vnto the earth, when the flood came.
\p
\v 18 An euerlasting Couenant was made with him, that all flesh should perish no more by the flood.
\p
\v 19 Abraham was a great father of many people: in glory was there none like vnto him:
\p
\v 20 Who kept the Law of the most High, and was in couenant with him, hee established the Couenant in his flesh, and when he was proued, he was found faithfull.
\p
\v 21 Therefore he assured him by an othe, that he would blesse the nations in his seed, and that he would multiply him, as the dust of the earth, and exalt his seed as the starres, and cause them to inherit from Sea to Sea, & from the riuer vnto the vtmost part of the land.
\p
\v 22 With Isaac did he establish likewise for Abraham his fathers sake the blessing of all men and the couenant,
\p
\v 23 And made it rest vpon the head of Iacob. Hee acknowledged him in his blessing, and gaue him an heritage, and diuided his portions, among the twelue tribes did he part them.

\c 45
\p
\v 1 And he brought out of him a mercifull man, which found fauour in the sight of all flesh, euen Moses beloued of God and men, whose memoriall is blessed:
\p
\v 2 He made him like to the glorious Saints, and magnified him, so that his enemies stood in feare of him.
\p
\v 3 By his words he caused the wonders to cease, and he made him glorious in the sight of kings, and gaue him a commaundement for his people, and shewed him part of his glory.
\p
\v 4 He sanctified him in his faithfulnesse, and meekenesse, and chose him out of all men.
\p
\v 5 He made him to heare his voyce, and brought him into the darke cloud, and gaue him commandements before his face, euen the law of life and knowledge, that hee might teach Iacob his Couenants, and Israel his iudgments.
\p
\v 6 He exalted Aaron an holy man like vnto him, euen his brother, of the tribe of Leui.
\p
\v 7 An euerlasting couenant he made with him, and gaue him the priesthood among the people, he beautified him with comely ornaments, and clothed him with a robe of glory.
\p
\v 8 Hee put vpon him perfect glory: and strengthened him with rich garments, with breeches, with a long robe, and the Ephod:
\p
\v 9 And he compassed him with pomegranates, and with many golden bels round about, that as he went, there might be a sound, and a noise made that might be heard in the Temple, for a memoriall to the children of his people.
\p
\v 10 With an holy garment, with gold and blew silke, and purple the worke of the embroiderer; with a brestplate of iudgement, and with Urim & Thummim.
\p
\v 11 With twisted scarlet, the worke of the cunning workeman, with precious stones grauen like seales, and set in gold, the worke of the Ieweller, with a writing engraued for a memoriall, after the number of the tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 12 He set a crowne of gold vpon the miter, wherein was engraued holinesse an ornament of honour, a costly worke, the desires of the eies goodly & beautiful.
\p
\v 13 Before him there were none such, neither did euer any stranger put them on, but onely his children, and his childrens children perpetually.
\p
\v 14 Their sacrifices shall be wholy consumed euery day twise continually.
\p
\v 15 Moises consecrated him, and annointed him with holy oile, this was appointed vnto him by an euerlasting couenant, and to his seed so long as the heauens should remaine, that they should minister vnto him, and execute the office of the priesthood, and blesse the people in his name.
\p
\v 16 He chose him out of all men liuing to offer sacrifices to the Lord, incense and a sweet sauour, for a memoriall, to make reconciliation for his people.
\p
\v 17 He gaue vnto him his commandements, and authority in the statutes of iudgements, that he should teach Iacob the testimonies, and informe Israel in his lawes.
\p
\v 18 Strangers conspired together against him, and maligned him in the wildernesse, euen the men that were of Dathans, and Abirons side, and the congregation of Core with fury and wrath.
\p
\v 19 This the Lord saw and it displeased him, and in his wrathfull indignation, were they consumed: he did wonders vpon them, to consume them with the fiery flame.
\p
\v 20 But he made Aaron more honourable, and gaue him an heritage, and diuided vnto him the first fruits of the encrease, especially he prepared bread in abundance:
\p
\v 21 For they eate of the sacrifices of the Lord, which he gaue vnto him and his seed:
\p
\v 22 Howbeit in the land of the people he had no inheritance, neither had he any portion among the people, for the Lord himselfe is his portion and inheritance.
\p
\v 23 The third in glory is Phinees the sonne of Eleazar, because he had zeale in the feare of the Lord, and stood vp with good courage of heart, when the people were turned backe, and made reconciliation for Israel.
\p
\v 24 Therfore was there a couenant of peace made with him, that he should be the cheefe of the sanctuary, and of his people, and that he, and his posteritie should haue the dignitie of the Priesthood for euer.
\p
\v 25 According to the couenant made with Dauid sonne of Iesse, of the tribe of Iuda, that the inheritance of the king should be to his posterity alone: so the inheritance of Aaron should also be vnto his seed.
\p
\v 26 God giue you wisedome in your heart to iudge his people in righteousnesse, that their good things be not abolished, and that their glory may endure for euer.

\c 46
\p
\v 1 Iesus the sonne of Naue was valiant in the wars, and was the successor of Moses in prophesies, who according to his name was made great for the sauing of the elect of God, and taking vengeance of the enemies that rose vp against them, that he might set Israel in their inheritance.
\p
\v 2 How great glory gat he when he did lift vp his hands, and stretched out his sword against the cities?
\p
\v 3 Who before him so stood to it? for the Lord himselfe brought his enemies vnto him.
\p
\v 4 Did not the Sunne goe backe by his meanes? and was not one day as long as two?
\p
\v 5 He called vpon the most high Lord, when the enemies pressed vpon him on euery side, & the great Lord heard him.
\p
\v 6 And with hailestones of mighty power he made the battell to fall violently vpon the nations, and in the descent (of Bethoron) hee destroyed them that resisted, that the nations might know all their strength, because hee fought in the sight of the Lord, and he followed the mightie one.
\p
\v 7 In the time of Moses also, he did a worke of mercie, hee and Caleb the sonne of Iephunne, in that they withstood the Congregation, and withheld the people from sinne, and appeased the wicked murmuring.
\p
\v 8 And of sixe hundred thousand people on foot, they two were preserued to bring them into the heritage, euen vnto the land that floweth with milk & hony.
\p
\v 9 The Lord gaue strength also vnto Caleb, which remained with him vnto his old age, so that he entred vpon the high places of the land, and his seed obtained it for an heritage.
\p
\v 10 That all the children of Israel might see that it is good to follow the Lord.
\p
\v 11 And concerning the Iudges, euery one by name, whose heart went not a whoring, nor departed from the Lord, let their memory be blessed.
\p
\v 12 Let their bones flourish out of their place, and let the name of them that were honoured, be continued vpon their children.
\p
\v 13 Samuel the Prophet of the Lord, beloued of his Lord, established a kingdom, & anointed princes ouer his people.
\p
\v 14 By the Law of the Lord hee iudged the Congregation, and the Lord had respect vnto Iacob.
\p
\v 15 By his faithfulnes he was found a true Prophet, and by his word he was knowen to be faithfull in vision.
\p
\v 16 He called vpon the mighty Lord, when his enemies pressed vpon him on euery side, when he offered the sucking lambe.
\p
\v 17 And the Lord thundered from heauen, and with a great noise made his voice to be heard.
\p
\v 18 And he destroyed the rulers of the Tyrians, and all the princes of the Philistines.
\p
\v 19 And before his long sleepe hee made protestations in the sight of the Lord, and his anoynted, I haue not taken any mans goods, so much as a shoe, and no man did accuse him.
\p
\v 20 And after his death he prophesied, and shewed the King his end, and lift vp his voyce from the earth in prophesie, to blot out the wickednesse of the people.

\c 47
\p
\v 1 And after him rose vp Nathan to prophesie in the time of Dauid.
\p
\v 2 As is the fat taken away from the peace offering, so was Dauid chosen out of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 3 Hee played with Lions as with kids, and with beares as with lambs.
\p
\v 4 Slew he not a gyant when hee was yet but yong? and did he not take away reproch from the people, when he lifted vp his hand with the stone in the sling, and beat downe the boasting of Goliah?
\p
\v 5 For he called vpon the most high Lord, and he gaue him strength in his right hand to slay that mighty warriour, and set vp the horne of his people:
\p
\v 6 So the people honoured him with ten thousands, and praised him in the blessings of the Lord, in that hee gaue him a crowne of glory.
\p
\v 7 For hee destroyed the enemies on euery side, and brought to nought the Philistines his aduersaries, and brake their horne in sunder vnto this day.
\p
\v 8 In all his workes hee praised the holy one most High, with words of glory, with his whole heart he sung songs, and loued him that made him.
\p
\v 9 He set singers also before the Altar, that by their voyces they might make sweet melody, and daily sing praises in their songs.
\p
\v 10 He beautified their feasts, and set in order the solemne times, vntill the ende, that they might praise his holy Name, and that the Temple might sound from morning.
\p
\v 11 The Lord tooke away his sinnes, and exalted his horne for euer: he gaue him a couenant of kings, and a throne of glory in Israel.
\p
\v 12 After him rose vp a wise sonne, and for his sake he dwelt at large.
\p
\v 13 Salomon reigned in a peaceable time, and was honoured; for God made all quiet round about him, that hee might build an house in his Name, and prepare his Sanctuary for euer.
\p
\v 14 How wise wast thou in thy youth, & as a flood filled with vnderstanding.
\p
\v 15 Thy soule couered the whole earth, and thou filledst it with dark parables.
\p
\v 16 Thy name went farre vnto the Ilands, and for thy peace thou wast beloued.
\p
\v 17 The countreys marueiled at thee for thy Songs, and Prouerbs, and Parables, and interpretations.
\p
\v 18 By the Name of the Lord God, which is called the Lord God of Israel, thou didst gather gold as tinne, and didst multiply siluer as lead.
\p
\v 19 Thou didst bow thy loines vnto women, and by thy body thou wast brought into subiection.
\p
\v 20 Thou dist staine thy honour, and pollute thy seed, so that thou broughtest wrath vpon thy children, and wast grieued for thy folly.
\p
\v 21 So the kingdome was diuided, and out of Ephraim ruled a rebellious kingdome.
\p
\v 22 But the Lord will neuer leaue off his mercy, neither shall any of his workes perish, neither will hee abolish the posterity of his elect, and the seed of him that loueth him he will not take away: wherefore he gaue a remnant vnto Iacob, and out of him a roote vnto Dauid.
\p
\v 23 Thus rested Solomon with his fathers, and of his seede he left behinde him Roboam, euen the foolishnesse of the people, and one that had no vnderstanding; who turned away the people through his counsell: there was also Ieroboam the sonne of Nabat, who caused Israel to sinne, and shewed Ephraim the way of sinne:
\p
\v 24 And their sinnes were multiplied exceedingly, that they were driuen out of the land.
\p
\v 25 For they sought out all wickednes, till the vengeance came vpon them.

\c 48
\p
\v 1 Then stood vp Elias the Prophet as fire, and his word burnt like a lampe.
\p
\v 2 He brought a sore famine vpon them, and by his zeale he diminished their number.
\p
\v 3 By the word of the Lord he shut vp the heauen, and also three times brought downe fire.
\p
\v 4 O Elias, how wast thou honoured in thy wondrous deedes! and who may glory like vnto thee!
\p
\v 5 Who didst raise vp a dead man from death, & his soule from the place of the dead by the word of the most Hie.
\p
\v 6 Who broughtest kings to destruction, and honourable men from their bedde.
\p
\v 7 Who heardest the rebuke of the Lord in Sinai, and in Horeb the iudgment of vengeance.
\p
\v 8 Who anointed kings to take reuenge, & Prophets to succeed after him:
\p
\v 9 Who wast taken vp in a whirlewinde of fire, and in a charet of fierie horses:
\p
\v 10 Who wast ordained for reproofes in their times, to pacifie the wrath of the Lordes iudgement before it brake foorth into fury, and to turne the heart of the father vnto the sonne, and to restore the tribes of Iacob.
\p
\v 11 Blessed are they that saw thee, and slept in loue, for we shal surely liue.
\p
\v 12 Elias it was, who was couered with a whirlewinde: and Elizeus was filled with his spirit: whilest he liued he was not mooued with the presence of any prince, neither could any bring him into subiection.
\p
\v 13 No word could ouercome him, & after his death his body prophecied.
\p
\v 14 He did wonders in his life, and at his death were his works marueilous.
\p
\v 15 For all this the people repented not, neither departed they from their sinnes, till they were spoiled and caried out of their land, and were scattered through all the earth: yet there remained a small people, and a ruler in the house of Dauid:
\p
\v 16 Of whom, some did that which was pleasing to God, and some multiplied sinnes.
\p
\v 17 Ezekias fortified his citie, and brought in water into the midst thereof: he digged the hard rocke with yron, and made welles for waters.
\p
\v 18 In his time Sennacherib came vp, and sent Rabsaces, and lift vp his hand against Sion, & boasted proudly.
\p
\v 19 Then trembled their hearts and handes, and they were in paine as women in trauell.
\p
\v 20 But they called vpon the Lord which is mercifull, and stretched out their hands towards him, and immediatly the holy One heard them out of heauen, and deliuered them by the ministery of Esay.
\p
\v 21 He smote the hoste of the Assyrians, and his Angel destroyed them.
\p
\v 22 For Ezekias had done the thing that pleased the Lord, and was strong in the wayes of Dauid his father, as Esay the Prophet, who was great and faithfull in his vision, had commaunded him.
\p
\v 23 In his time the Sunne went backeward, and hee lengthened the kings life.
\p
\v 24 Hee sawe by an excellent spirit what should come to passe at the last, and hee comforted them that mourned in Sion.
\p
\v 25 He shewed what should come to passe for euer, and secret things or euer they came.

\c 49
\p
\v 1 The remembrance of Iosias is like the composition of the perfume &thorn;t is made by the arte of the Apothecarie: it is sweete as hony in all mouthes, and as musicke at a banquet of wine.
\p
\v 2 He behaued himselfe vprightly in the conuersion of the people, and tooke away the abominations of iniquitie.
\p
\v 3 He directed his heart vnto the Lord, and in the time of the vngodly he established the worship of God.
\p
\v 4 All, except Dauid and Ezechias, and Iosias, were defectiue: for they forsooke the Law of the most High, (euen) the kings of Iudah failed:
\p
\v 5 Therefore he gaue their power vnto others, & their glory to a strange nation.
\p
\v 6 They burnt the chosen citie of the Sanctuarie, and made the streets desolate according to the prophecie of Ieremias:
\p
\v 7 For they entreated him euil, who neuerthelesse was a prophet sanctified in his mothers wombe, that he might root out and afflict & destroy, and that he might build vp also and plant.
\p
\v 8 It was Ezechiel who sawe the glorious vision, which was shewed him vpon the chariot of the Cherubims
\p
\v 9 For he made mention of the enemies vnder the figure of the raine, and directed them that went right.
\p
\v 10 And of the twelue prophets let the memorial be blessed, and let their bones flourish againe out of their place: for they comforted Iacob, and deliuered them by assured hope.
\p
\v 11 How shall we magnifie Zorobabel? euen he was as a signet on the right hand.
\p
\v 12 So was Iesus the sonne of Iosedec: who in their time builded the house, and set vp an holy Temple to the Lord, which was prepared for euerlasting glory.
\p
\v 13 And among the elect was Neemias whose renowme is great, who raised vp for vs, the walles that were fallen, and set vp the gates & the barres, and raised vp our ruines againe.
\p
\v 14 But vpon the earth was no man created like Enoch, for he was taken from the earth.
\p
\v 15 Neither was there a man borne like vnto Ioseph, a gouernour of his brethren, a stay of the people, whose bones were regarded of the Lord.
\p
\v 16 Sem and Seth were in great honour among men, and so was Adam aboue euery liuing thing in the creation.

\c 50
\p
\v 1 Simon the high priest the sonne of Onias, who in his life repaired the house againe, and in his dayes fortified the Temple:
\p
\v 2 And by him was built from the foundation the double height, the high fortresse of the wall about the Temple.
\p
\v 3 In his dayes the cisterne to receiue water being in compasse as the sea, was couered with plates of brasse.
\p
\v 4 He tooke care of the Temple that it should not fall, and fortified the citie against besieging.
\p
\v 5 How was he honoured in the midst of the people, in his comming out of the Sanctuarie?
\p
\v 6 He was as the morning starre in the midst of a cloud: and as the moone at the full.
\p
\v 7 As the Sunne shining vpon the Temple of the most High, and as the rainebow giuing light in the bright cloudes.
\p
\v 8 And as the flowre of roses in the spring of the yeere, as lillies by the riuers of waters, and as the branches of the frankincense tree in the time of summer.
\p
\v 9 As fire and incense in the censer, and as a vessell of beaten gold set with all maner of precious stones,
\p
\v 10 And as a faire oliue tree budding forth fruit, and as a Cypresse tree which groweth vp to the cloudes.
\p
\v 11 When he put on the robe of honour, and was clothed with the perfection of glory, when he went vp to the holy altar, he made the garment of holinesse honourable.
\p
\v 12 When he tooke the portions out of the priests hands, hee himselfe stood by the hearth of the altar, compassed with his brethren round about, as a yong cedar in Libanus, and as palme trees compassed they him round about.
\p
\v 13 So were all the sonnes of Aaron in their glory, and the oblations of the Lord in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel.
\p
\v 14 And finishing the seruice at the altar, that he might adorne the offring of the most high Almighty,
\p
\v 15 He stretched out his hand to the cup, and powred of the blood of the grape, he powred out at the foote of the altar, a sweet smelling sauour vnto the most high King of all.
\p
\v 16 Then shouted the sonnes of Aaron, and sounded the siluer trumpets, and made a great noise to be heard, for a remembrance before the most High.
\p
\v 17 Then all the people together hasted, and fell downe to the earth vpon their faces to worship their Lord God almighty the most High.
\p
\v 18 The singers also sang praises with their voices, with great variety of sounds was there made sweete melodie.
\p
\v 19 And the people besought the Lord the most High by prayer before him that is mercifull, till the solemnity of the Lord was ended, and they had finished his seruice.
\p
\v 20 Then he went downe, and lifted vp his hands ouer the whole congregation of the children of Israel, to giue the blessing of the Lord with his lips, and to reioyce in his name.
\p
\v 21 And they bowed themselues downe to worship the second time, that they might receiue a blessing from the most High.
\p
\v 22 Now therefore blesse yee the God of all, which onely doth wonderous things euery where, which exalteth our daies from the wombe, and dealeth with vs according to his mercy.
\p
\v 23 He grant vs ioyfulnesse of heart, and that peace may be in our daies in Israel for euer.
\p
\v 24 That hee would confirme his mercy with vs, and deliuer vs at his time.
\p
\v 25 There be two maner of nations which my heart abhorreth, and the third is no nation.
\p
\v 26 They that sit vpon the mountaine of Samaria, and they that dwell amongst the Philistines, and that foolish people that dwell in Sichem.
\p
\v 27 Iesus the sonne of Sirach of Hierusalem hath written in this booke, the instruction of vnderstanding and knowledge, who out of his heart powred forth wisedome.
\p
\v 28 Blessed is he that shall be exercised in these things, and hee that layeth them vp in his heart, shall become wise.
\p
\v 29 For if he doe them, hee shall be strong to all things, for the light of the Lord leadeth him, who giueth wisedome to the godly: blessed be the Lord for euer. Amen. Amen.

\c 51
\p
\v 1 I will thanke thee, O Lord and king, and praise thee O God my Sauiour, I doe giue praise vnto thy name:
\p
\v 2 For thou art my defeuder, and helper, and hast preserued my body from destruction, and from the snare of the slanderous tongue, and from the lippes that forge lies, and hast beene my helper against mine aduersaries.
\p
\v 3 And hast deliuered me according to the multitude of thy mercies, and greatnesse of thy name, from the teeth of them that were ready to deuoure me, and out of the hands of such as sought after my life, and from the manifold afflictions which I had:
\p
\v 4 From the choking of fire on euery side, and from the mids of the fire, which I kindled not:
\p
\v 5 From the depth of the belly of hel, from an vncleane tongue, and from lying words.
\p
\v 6 By an accusation to the king from an vnrighteous tongue, my soule drew neere euen vnto death, my life was neere to the hell beneath:
\p
\v 7 They compassed me on euery side, and there was no man to helpe me: I looked for the succour of men, but there was none:
\p
\v 8 Then thought I vpon thy mercy, O Lord, and vpon thy acts of old, how thou deliuerest such as waite for thee, and sauest them out of the hands of the enemies:
\p
\v 9 Then lifted I vp my supplication from the earth, and prayed for deliuerance from death.
\p
\v 10 I called vpon the Lord the father of my Lord, that he would not leaue me in the dayes of my trouble, & in the time of the proud when there was no helpe.
\p
\v 11 I will praise thy Name continually, and will sing praise with thankesgiuing, and so my prayer was heard:
\p
\v 12 For thou sauedst me from destruction, and deliuerest mee from the euill time: therefore will I giue thankes and praise thee, and blesse thy Name, O Lord.
\p
\v 13 When I was yet yong, or euer I went abroad, I desired wisedome openly in my prayer.
\p
\v 14 I prayed for her before the Temple, & will seeke her out euen to the end:
\p
\v 15 Euen from the flowre till the grape was ripe, hath my heart delighted in her, my foot went the right way, from my youth vp sought I after her.
\p
\v 16 I bowed downe mine eare a litle and receiued her, & gate much learning.
\p
\v 17 I profited therein, therefore will I ascribe the glory vnto him that giueth me wisedome:
\p
\v 18 For I purposed to doe after her, and earnestly I followed that which is good, so shall I not be confounded:
\p
\v 19 My soule hath wrestled with her, and in my doings I was exact, I stretched foorth my hands to the heauen aboue, & bewailed my ignorances of her.
\p
\v 20 I directed my soule vnto her, and I found her in purenesse, I haue had my heart ioyned with her from the beginning, therefore shall I not bee forsaken.
\p
\v 21 My heart was troubled in seeking her: therefore haue I gotten a good possession.
\p
\v 22 The Lord hath giuen mee a tongue for my reward, and I wil praise him therewith.
\p
\v 23 Draw neere vnto me you vnlearned, and dwell in the house of learning.
\p
\v 24 Wherefore are you slow, and what say you of these things, seeing your soules are very thirstie?
\p
\v 25 I opened my mouth, and said, buy her for your selues without money.
\p
\v 26 Put your necke vnder the yoke, and let your soule receiue instruction, she is hard at hand to finde.
\p
\v 27 Behold with your eies, how that I haue had but little labour, and haue gotten vnto me much rest.
\p
\v 28 Get learning with a great summe of money, and get much gold by her.
\p
\v 29 Let your soule reioyce in his mercy, and be not ashamed of his praise.
\p
\v 30 Worke your worke betimes, & in his time he will giue you your reward.
