\c 5
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 2 Commaund the children of Israel, that they put out of the campe euery leper, and euery one that hath an issue, and whosoeuer is defiled by the dead:
\p
\v 3 Both male and female shal ye put out, without the campe shall yee put them, that they defile not their campes in the middest whereof I dwell.
\p
\v 4 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out, without the campe: as the Lord spake vnto Moses, so did the children of Israel.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 6 Speake vnto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sinne that men commit, to doe a trespasse against the Lord, and that person be guiltie;
\p
\v 7 Then they shall confesse their sinne, which they haue done: and hee shall recompense his trespasse, with the principall thereof, and adde vnto it the fifth part thereof, and giue it vnto him against whom he hath trespassed.
\p
\v 8 But if the man haue no kinsman to recompense the trespasse vnto, let the trespasse be recompensed vnto the Lord, euen to the Priest: beside the ramme of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.
\p
\v 9 And euery offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring vnto the Priest, shall be his.
\p
\v 10 And euery mans halowed things shall be his: whatsoeuer any man giueth the Priest, it shall be his.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 12 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, If any mans wife goe aside, and commit a trespasse against him;
\p
\v 13 And a man lye with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witnesse against her, neither she be taken with the maner;
\p
\v 14 And the spirit of ielousie come vpon him, and he be ielous of his wife, and shee be defiled: or if the spirit of ielousie come vpon him, and hee be ielous of his wife, and she be not defiled:
\p
\v 15 Then shall the man bring his wife vnto the Priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an Ephah of barley meale: hee shall powre no oyle vpon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of ielousie, an offering of memoriall, bringing iniquitie to remembrance:
\p
\v 16 And the Priest shall bring her neere, and set her before the Lord.
\p
\v 17 And the Priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessell, and of the dust that is in the floore of the Tabernacle the Priest shall take, and put it into the water:
\p
\v 18 And the Priest shall set the woman before the Lord, and vncouer the womans head, and put the offering of memoriall in her hands, which is the Ielousie offering: and the Priest shall haue in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse.
\p
\v 19 And the Priest shall charge her by an othe, and say vnto the woman, If no man haue lyen with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to vncleannesse with another in stead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse.
\p
\v 20 But if thou hast gone aside to another in stead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man hath lien with thee beside thine husband:
\p
\v 21 Then the Priest shall charge the woman with an othe of cursing, and the Priest shall say vnto the woman, The Lord make thee a curse, and an othe among thy people, when the Lord doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell.
\p
\v 22 And this water that causeth the curse, shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: and the woman shall say, Amen, Amen.
\p
\v 23 And the Priest shall write these curses in a booke, and hee shall blot them out with the bitter water:
\p
\v 24 And he shall cause the woman to drinke the bitter water, that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.
\p
\v 25 Then the Priest shall take the ielousie offering out of the womans hand, and shall waue the offering before the Lord, and offer it vpon the Altar.
\p
\v 26 And the Priest shal take an handfull of the offering, euen the memoriall thereof, and burne it vpon the Altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drinke the water.
\p
\v 27 And when he hath made her to drinke the water, then it shall come to passe, that if shee be defiled, and haue done trespasse against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse, shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shal rot: and the woman shalbe a curse among her people.
\p
\v 28 And if the woman be not defiled, but be cleane, then she shall be free, and shall conceiue seed.
\p
\v 29 This is the law of ielousies, when a wife goeth aside to another in stead of her husband, and is defiled:
\p
\v 30 Or when the spirit of ielousie commeth vpon him, and hee be ielous ouer his wife, and shall set the woman before the Lord, and the Priest shal execute vpon her all this law.
\p
\v 31 Then shall the man bee guiltlesse from iniquitie, and this woman shall beare her iniquitie.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When either man or woman shall separate themselues to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselues vnto the Lord:
\p
\v 3 Hee shall separate himselfe from wine, and strong drinke, and shal drinke no vineger of wine, or vineger of strong drinke, neither shal he drinke any liquor of grapes, nor eate moist grapes, or dried.
\p
\v 4 All the dayes of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels euen to the huske.
\p
\v 5 All the dayes of the vow of his separation, there shall no rasour come vpon his head: vntill the dayes bee fulfilled in the which hee separateth himselfe vnto the Lord, he shall be holy, and shall let the lockes of the haire of his head grow.
\p
\v 6 All the dayes that he separateth himselfe vnto the Lord, hee shall come at no dead body.
\p
\v 7 Hee shall not make himselfe vncleane for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is vpon his head.
\p
\v 8 All the dayes of his separation he is holy vnto the Lord.
\p
\v 9 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration, then he shall shaue his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seuenth day shall he shaue it.
\p
\v 10 And on the eight day he shal bring two turtles or two yong pigeons to the Priest, to the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.
\p
\v 11 And the Priest shall offer the one for a sinne offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that hee sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.
\p
\v 12 And hee shall consecrate vnto the Lord the dayes of his separation, and shall bring a lambe of the first yeere for a trespasse offering: but the dayes that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And this is the Lawe of the Nazarite: when the dayes of his separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.
\p
\v 14 And he shall offer his offring vnto the Lord, one hee lambe of the first yeere without blemish, for a burnt offering, and one ewe lambe of the first yeere without blemish, for a sinne offering, and one lambe without blemish for peace offerings,
\p
\v 15 And a basket of vnleauened bread, cakes of fine flowre mingled with oyle, and wafers of vnleauened bread anointed with oyle, and their meate offering, and their drinke offerings.
\p
\v 16 And the Priest shall bring them before the Lord, and shall offer his sinne offering, and his burnt offering.
\p
\v 17 And he shall offer the ramme for a sacrifice of peace offerings vnto the Lord, with the basket of vnleauened bread: the Priest shall offer also his meate offering, and his drinke offering.
\p
\v 18 And the Nazarite shal shaue the head of his separation, at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and shall take the haire of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is vnder the sacrifice of the peace offerings.
\p
\v 19 And the Priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ramme, and one vnleauened cake out of the basket, and one vnleauened wafer, and shall put them vpon the hands of the Nazarite, after the haire of his separation is shauen.
\p
\v 20 And the Priest shall waue them for a waue offring before the Lord: this is holy for the Priest, with the waue breast, and heaue shoulder: and after that, the Nazarite may drinke wine.
\p
\v 21 This is the Law of the Nazarite, who hath vowed, and of his offering vnto the Lord for his separation, besides that, that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation.
\p
\v 22 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 23 Speake vnto Aaron, and vnto his sonnes, saying, On this wise ye shall blesse the children of Israel, saying vnto them:
\p
\v 24 The Lord blesse thee, and keepe thee:
\p
\v 25 The Lord make his face shine vpon thee, and be gracious vnto thee:
\p
\v 26 The Lord lift vp his countenance vpon thee, and giue thee peace.
\p
\v 27 And they shall put my Name vpon the children of Israel, and I will blesse them.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe on the day that Moses had fully set vp the Tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the Altar, and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them:
\p
\v 2 That the Princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, (who were the Princes of the tribes, and were ouer them that were numbred) offered:
\p
\v 3 And they brought their offering before the Lord, sixe couered wagons, and twelue oxen: a wagon for two of the Princes, and for each one an oxe, and they brought them before the Tabernacle.
\p
\v 4 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 5 Take it of them, that they may be to doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thou shalt giue them vnto the Leuites, to euery man according to his seruice.
\p
\v 6 And Moses tooke the wagons, and the oxen, and gaue them vnto the Leuites.
\p
\v 7 Two wagons and foure oxen he gaue vnto the sonnes of Gershon, according to their seruice.
\p
\v 8 And foure wagons and eight oxen he gaue vnto the sonnes of Merari, according vnto their seruice, vnder the hand of Ithamar the sonne of Aaron the Priest.
\p
\v 9 But vnto the sonnes of Kohath he gaue none: because the seruice of the Sanctuary belonging vnto them, was that they should beare vpon their shoulders.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the Princes offered for dedicating of the Altar, in the day that it was anointed, euen the Princes offered their offering before the Altar.

\v 17 For all the first borne of the children of Israel, are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote euery first borne in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for my selfe.
\p
\v 18 And I haue taken the Leuites for all the first borne of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 19 And I haue giuen the Leuites as a gift to Aaron, and to his sonnes, from among the children of Israel, to do the seruice of the children of Israel, in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there bee no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh vnto the Sanctuarie.
\p
\v 20 And Moses and Aaron, and all the Congregation of the children of Israel did to the Leuites according vnto all that the Lord commanded Moses, concerning the Leuites, so did the children of Israel vnto them.
\p
\v 21 And the Leuites were purified, and they washed their clothes: and Aaron offered them as an offering before the Lord, and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.
\p
\v 22 And after that, went the Leuites in, to do their seruice in the Tabernacle of the Congregation before Aaron and and before his sonnes: as the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Leuites, so did they vnto them.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 24 This is it that belongeth vnto the Leuites: from twentie and fiue yeeres old, and vpward, they shall goe in to waite vpon the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.
\p
\v 25 And from the age of fiftie yeeres they shall cease waiting vpon the seruice thereof, and shall serue no more:
\p
\v 26 But shall minister with their brethren in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, to keepe the charge, and shall doe no seruice: thus shalt thou doe vnto the Leuites, touching their charge.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses in the wildernesse of Sinai, in the first moneth of the second yeere; after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
\p
\v 2 Let the children of Israel also keepe the Passeouer, at his appointed season.
\p
\v 3 In the fourteenth day of this moneth at euen, ye shall keepe it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keepe it.
\p
\v 4 And Moses spake vnto the children of Israel that they should keepe the Passeouer.
\p
\v 5 And they kept the Passeouer on the fourteenth day of the first moneth at Euen, in the wildernesse of Sinai: according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.
\p
\v 6 ¶ And there were certaine men who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keepe the Passeouer on that day: and they came before Moses, and before Aaron on that day.
\p
\v 7 And those men said vnto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept backe, that wee may not offer an offring of the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel?
\p
\v 8 And Moses saide vnto them, Stand still, and I will heare what the Lord wil command concerning you.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 10 Speake vnto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you, or of your posteritie shall be vncleane by reason of a dead body, or bee in a iourney afarre off, yet he shall keepe the Passeouer vnto the Lord.
\p
\v 11 The fourteenth day of the second moneth at Euen they shall keepe it, and eat it with vnleauened bread and bitter herbes.
\p
\v 12 They shall leaue none of it vnto the morning, nor breake any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the Passeouer they shall keepe it.
\p
\v 13 But the man that is cleane, and is not in a iourney, and forbeareth to keep the Passeouer, euen the same soule shall be cut off from his people, because hee brought not the offering of the Lord in his appointed season: that man shall beare his sinne.
\p
\v 14 And if a stranger shall soiourne among you, and will keepe the Passeouer vnto the Lord; according to the ordinance of the Passeouer, and according to the maner thereof, so shall he doe: ye shall haue one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was borne in the land.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And on the day that the Tabernacle was reared vp, the cloud couered the Tabernacle, namely the Tent of the Testimony: and at Euen there was vpon the Tabernacle, as it were the appearance of fire, vntill the morning.
\p
\v 16 So it was always: the cloud couered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.
\p
\v 17 And when the cloud was taken vp from the Tabernacle, then after that, the children of Israel iourneyed, and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.
\p
\v 18 At the commandement of the Lord the children of Israel iourneied, and at the commandement of the Lord they pitched: as long as the cloud abode vpon the Tabernacle, they rested in the tents.
\p
\v 19 And when the cloud taried long vpon the Tabernacle many daies, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the Lord, and iourneyed not.
\p
\v 20 And so it was when the cloude was a few daies vpon the Tabernacle, according to the commandement of the Lord, they abode in their tents, and according to the commandement of the Lord, they iourneyed.
\p
\v 21 And so it was when the cloude abode from Euen vnto the morning, and that the cloude was taken vp in the morning, then they iourneyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloude was taken vp, they iourneyed.
\p
\v 22 Or whether it were two dayes, or a moneth, or a yeere that the cloude taried vpon the Tabernacle, remayning thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and iourneyed not: but when it was taken vp, they iourneyed.
\p
\v 23 At the commandement of the Lord they rested in the tents, and at the commaundement of the Lord they iourneyed: they kept the charge of the Lord, at the commandement of the Lord by the hand of Moses.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 2 Make thee two trumpets of siluer: of an whole piece shalt thou make them, that thou mayest vse them for the calling of the assembly, and for the iourneying of the campes.
\p
\v 3 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselues to thee, at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.
\p
\v 4 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the Princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselues vnto thee.
\p
\v 5 When ye blow an alarme, then the campes that lie on the East parts, shall goe forward.
\p
\v 6 When you blow an alarme the second time, then the campes that lye on the Southside, shall take their iourney: they shall blow an alarme for their iourneys.
\p
\v 7 But when the Congregation is to be gathered together, you shal blow: but you shall not sound an alarme.
\p
\v 8 And the sonnes of Aaron the Priests shall blow with the trumpets; and they shalbe to you for an ordinance for euer throughout your generations.
\p
\v 9 And if ye goe to warre in your land, against the enemie that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarme with the trumpets, and ye shalbe remembred before the Lord your God, and yee shalbe saued from your enemies.
\p
\v 10 Also in the day of your gladnesse, and in your solemne dayes, and in the beginnings of your monethes, ye shall blow with the trumpets ouer your burnt offerings, and ouer the sacrifices of your peace offerings, that they may bee to you for a memoriall before your God: I am the Lord your God.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And it came to passe on the twentieth day of the second moneth, in the second yeere, that the cloude was taken vp from off the Tabernacle of the Testimony.
\p
\v 12 And the children of Israel tooke their iourneys out of the wildernesse of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wildernesse of Paran.
\p
\v 13 And they first tooke their iourney, according to the commandement of the Lord, by the hand of Moses.
\p
\v 14 ¶ In the first place went the standerd of the campe of the children of Iudah, according to their armies, and ouer his hoste was Nahshon the sonne of Amminadab.
\p
\v 15 And ouer the hoste of the tribe of the children of Issachar, was Nethaneel the sonne of Zuar.
\p
\v 16 And ouer the hoste of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, was Eliab the sonne of Helon.
\p
\v 17 And the Tabernacle was taken downe, and the sonnes of Gershon, and the sonnes of Merari set forward, bearing the Tabernacle.
\p
\v 18 ¶ And the standerd of the campe of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and ouer his hoste was Elizur the sonne of Shedeur.
\p
\v 19 And ouer the hoste of the tribe of the children of Simeon, was Shelumiel the sonne of Zurishaddai.
\p
\v 20 And ouer the hoste of the tribe of the children of Gad, was Eliasaph the sonne of Deuel.
\p
\v 21 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the Sanctuary, and the other did set vp the Tabernacle against they came.
\p
\v 22 ¶ And the standerd of the campe of the children of Ephraim set forward, according to their armies, and ouer his hoste was Elishama the sonne of Ammiud.
\p
\v 23 And ouer the hoste of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the sonne of Pedazur.
\p
\v 24 And ouer the hoste of the tribe of the children of Beniamin, was Abidan the soune of Gideoni.
\p
\v 25 ¶ And the standerd of the campe of the children of Dan set forward, which was the rere-ward of all the campes throughout their hostes: and ouer his hoste was Ahiezer the sonne of Ammishaddai.
\p
\v 26 And ouer the hoste of the tribe of the children of Asher, was Pagiel the sonne of Ocran.
\p
\v 27 And ouer the hoste of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the sonne of Enan.
\p
\v 28 Thus were the iourneyings of the children of Israel, according to their armies, when they set forward.
\p
\v 29 ¶ And Moses said vnto Hobab the sonne of Raguel the Midianite Moses father in law, Wee are iourneying vnto the place of which the Lord said, I wil giue it you: come thou with vs, and we will doe thee good: for the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel.
\p
\v 30 And he said vnto him, I will not goe, but I will depart to mine owne land, and to my kinred.
\p
\v 31 And he said, Leaue vs not, I pray thee, forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encampe in the wilderuesse, and thou mayest bee to vs in stead of eyes.
\p
\v 32 And it shall bee if thou goe with vs, yea it shall be, that what goodnesse the Lord shall doe vnto vs, the same will we doe vnto thee.
\p
\v 33 ¶ And they departed from the Mount of the Lord three dayes iourney: and the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord went before them in the three dayes iourney, to search out a resting place for them.
\p
\v 34 And the cloude of the Lord was vpon them by day, when they went out of the campe.
\p
\v 35 And it came to passe when the Arke set forward, that Moses said, Rise vp Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered, and let them that hate thee, flee before thee.
\p
\v 36 And when it rested, he said, Returne, O Lord, vnto the many thousands of Israel.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord: and the Lord heard it: and his anger was kindled, and the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the vttermost parts of the campe.
\p
\v 2 And the people cried vnto Moses, and when Moses prayed vnto the Lord, the fire was quenched.
\p
\v 3 And hee called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the Lord burnt among them.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And the mixt multitude that was among them, fell a lusting, and the children of Israel also wept againe, and said, Who shal giue vs flesh to eate?
\p
\v 5 We remember the fish which wee did eate in Egypt freely: the cucumbers and the melons, and the leekes, and the onions, and the garlicke.
\p
\v 6 But now our soule is dried away, there is nothing at all, besides this Manna, before our eyes.
\p
\v 7 And the Manna was as Coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of Bdelium:
\p
\v 8 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in milles, or beat it in a morter, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oyle.
\p
\v 9 And when the dew fell vpon the campe in the night, the Manna fell vpon it.
\p
\v 10 ¶ Then Moses heard the people weepe throughout their families, euery man in the doore of his tent, and the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly, Moses also was displeased.
\p
\v 11 And Moses said vnto the Lord, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy seruant? and wherefore haue I not found fauour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people vpon me?
\p
\v 12 Haue I conceiued all this people? haue I begotten them, that thou shouldest say vnto me, Cary them in thy bosome (as a nursing father beareth the sucking child) vnto the land which thou swarest vnto their fathers?
\p
\v 13 Whence should I haue flesh to giue vnto all this people? for they weep vnto me, saying, Giue vs flesh, that we may eate.
\p
\v 14 I am not able to beare all this people alone, because it is too heauie for mee.
\p
\v 15 And if thou deale thus with mee, kill me, I pray thee out of hand, if I haue found fauour in thy sight, and let me not see my wretchednesse.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And the Lord said vnto Moses, Gather vnto me seuentie men, of the Elders of Israel, whome thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers ouer them: and bring them vnto the Tabernacle of the Congregation, that they may stand there with thee.
\p
\v 17 And I will come downe and talke with thee there, and I will take of the spirit which is vpon thee, and wil put it vpon them, and they shall beare the burden of the people with thee, that thou beare it not thy selfe alone.
\p
\v 18 And say thou vnto the people, Sanctifie your selues against to morrow, and yee shall eate flesh: (for you haue wept in the eares of the Lord, saying, Who shall giue vs flesh to eate? for it was well with vs in Egypt:) therfore the Lord wil giue you flesh, and ye shall eate.
\p
\v 19 Ye shall not eate one day, nor two dayes, nor fiue dayes, neither ten dayes, nor twentie dayes:
\p
\v 20 But euen a whole moneth, vntill it come out at your nostrels, and it bee loathsome vnto you, because that yee haue despised the Lord which is among you, and haue wept before him, saying, Why came we foorth out of Egypt?
\p
\v 21 And Moses said, The people amongst whome I am, are sixe hundred thousand footmen, and thou hast said, I will giue them flesh, that they may eate a whole moneth.
\p
\v 22 Shall the flockes and the herds be slaine for them to suffice them? or shal all the fish of the sea bee gathered together for them, to suffice them?
\p
\v 23 And the Lord said vnto Moses, Is the Lords hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to passe vnto thee, or not.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And Moses went out, and tolde the people the wordes of the Lord, and gathered the seuenty men of the Elders of the people, and set them round about the Tabernacle.
\p
\v 25 And the Lord came downe in a cloude, and spake vnto him, and tooke of the spirit that was vpon him, and gaue it vnto the seuentie Elders: and it came to passe that when the spirit rested vpon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.
\p
\v 26 But there remained two of the men in the campe, the name of the one was Eldad, & the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested vpon them, (and they were of them that were written, but went not out vnto the Tabernacle) and they prophesied in the campe.
\p
\v 27 And there ranne a yong man, and tolde Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad doe prophesie in the campe.
\p
\v 28 And Ioshua the sonne of Nun the seruant of Moses, one of his yong men, answered and said, My lord Moses, Forbid them.
\p
\v 29 And Moses said vnto him, Enuiest thou for my sake? Would God that all the Lords people were Prophets, and that the Lord would put his Spirit vpon them.
\p
\v 30 And Moses gate him into the campe, he, and the Elders of Israel.
\p
\v 31 ¶ And there went forth a winde from the Lord, and brought quailes from the sea, and let them fall by the campe, as it were a dayes iourney on this side, and as it were a dayes iourney on the other side round about the campe, and as it were two cubits high vpon the face of the earth.
\p
\v 32 And the people stood vp all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quailes: he that gathered least, gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselues round about the campe.
\p
\v 33 And while the flesh was yet betweene their teeth, yer it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague.
\p
\v 34 And he called the name of that place, Kibroth-Hattaauah: because there they buried the people that lusted.
\p
\v 35 And the people iourneyed from Kibroth-Hattaauah, vnto Hazeroth: and abode at Hazeroth.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses, because of the Ethiophian woman, whom hee had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.
\p
\v 2 And they said, Hath the Lord indeed spoken onely by Moses? Hath hee not spoken also by vs? And the Lord heard it.
\p
\v 3 (Now the man Moses was very meeke, aboue all the men which were vpon the face of the earth.)
\p
\v 4 And the Lord spake suddenly vnto Moses, and vnto Aaron, and vnto Miriam, Come out ye three vnto the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and they three came out.
\p
\v 5 And the Lord came downe in the pillar of the cloude, and stood in the doore of the Tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came foorth.
\p
\v 6 And hee saide, Heare now my words: If there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my selfe knowen vnto him in a vision, and will speake vnto him in a dreame:
\p
\v 7 My seruant Moses is not so, who is faithfull in all mine house.
\p
\v 8 With him will I speake mouth to mouth euen apparantly, and not in darke speeches, and the similitude of the Lord shall hee behold: wherefore then were yee not afraid to speake against my seruant Moses?
\p
\v 9 And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and he departed.
\p
\v 10 And the cloud departed from off the Tabernacle, and behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked vpon Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.
\p
\v 11 And Aaron said vnto Moses, Alas my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sinne vpon vs, wherein we haue done foolishly, and wherein we haue sinned:
\p
\v 12 Let her not bee as one dead, of whom the flesh is halfe consumed, when he commeth out of his mothers wombe.
\p
\v 13 And Moses cryed vnto the Lord, saying, Heale her now, O God, I beseech thee.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And the Lord said vnto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not bee ashamed seuen dayes? let her be shut out from the campe seuen dayes, and after that let her be receiued in againe.
\p
\v 15 And Miriam was shut out from the campe seuen dayes: and the people iourneied not, til Miriam was brought in againe.
\p
\v 16 And afterward the people remoued from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wildernesse of Paran.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 2 Send thou men, that they may search the lande of Canaan, which I giue vnto the children of Israel: of euery tribe of their fathers shal ye send a man, euery one a ruler among them.
\p
\v 3 And Moses by the commaundement of the Lord, sent them from the wildernes of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 4 And these were their names. Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the sonne of Zaccur.
\p
\v 5 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the sonne of Hori.
\p
\v 6 Of the tribe of Iudah, Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh.
\p
\v 7 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the sonne of Ioseph.
\p
\v 8 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the sonne of Nun.
\p
\v 9 Of the tribe of Beniamin, Palti the sonne of Raphu.
\p
\v 10 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the sonne of Sodi.
\p
\v 11 Of the tribe of Ioseph, namely of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the sonne of Susi.
\p
\v 12 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the sonne of Gemalli.
\p
\v 13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the sonne of Michael.
\p
\v 14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the sonne of Uophsi.
\p
\v 15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the sonne of Machi.
\p
\v 16 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spie out the land: and Moses called Oshea the sonne of Nun, Iehoshua.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And Moses sent them to spie out the land of Canaan, and said vnto them, Get you by this way Southward, and goe vp into the mountaine:
\p
\v 18 And see the lande what it is, and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they bee strong or weake, fewe or many:
\p
\v 19 And what the lande is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad, and what cities they bee that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds:
\p
\v 20 And what the land is, whether it be fat or leane, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land: (Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes)
\p
\v 21 ¶ So they went vp, and searched the land, from the wildernesse of Zin, vnto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
\p
\v 22 And they ascended by the South, and came vnto Hebron: where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak were: Now Hebron was built seuen yeeres before Zoan in Egypt.
\p
\v 23 And they came vnto the brooke of Eshcol, and cut downe from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it betweene two vpon a staffe, and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs.
\p
\v 24 The place was called the brooke Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut downe from thence.
\p
\v 25 And they returned from searching of the land after fourty dayes.
\p
\v 26 ¶ And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the Congregation of the children of Israel vnto the wildernesse of Paran, to Kadesh, and brought backe word vnto them, and vnto all the Congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.
\p
\v 27 And they told him, and said, We came vnto the land whither thou sentest vs, & surely it floweth with milke and honie; and this is the fruit of it.
\p
\v 28 Neuerthelesse, the people bee strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled and very great: and moreouer, we saw the children of Anak there.
\p
\v 29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South: and the Hittites, and the Iebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountaines: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Iordane.
\p
\v 30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let vs goe vp at once, and possesse it, for we are well able to ouercome it.
\p
\v 31 But the men that went vp with him, said, Wee be not able to goe vp against the people, for they are stronger then we.
\p
\v 32 And they brought vp an euill report of the land which they had searched, vnto the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we haue gone, to search it, is a land that eateth vp the inhabitants thereof, and all the people that we saw in it, are men of a great stature.
\p
\v 33 And there we saw the giants, the sonnes of Anak, which come of the giants: and wee were in our owne sight as grashoppers, and so wee were in their sight.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 And all the Congregation lifted vp their voyce and cried; and the people wept that night.
\p
\v 2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses, and against Aaron: and the whole Congregation said vnto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt, or would God we had died in this wildernesse.
\p
\v 3 And wherefore hath the Lord brought vs vnto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wiues, and our children should be a pray? Were it not better for vs to returne into Egypt?
\p
\v 4 And they saide one to another, Let vs make a captaine, and let vs returne into Egypt.
\p
\v 5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the Congregation of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 6 ¶ And Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes.
\p
\v 7 And they spake vnto all the company of the children of Israel, saying. The land which wee passed thorow to search it, is an exceeding good land.
\p
\v 8 If the Lord delight in vs, then he will bring vs into this land, and giue it vs, a land which floweth with milke and hony.
\p
\v 9 Onely rebell not yee against the Lord, neither feare yee the people of the land, for they are bread for vs: their defence is departed from them, and the Lord is with vs: feare them not.
\p
\v 10 But all the Congregation bade stone them with stones: and the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before all the children of Israel.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And the Lord said vnto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it bee, yer they beleeue me, for all the signes which I haue shewed among them?
\p
\v 12 I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherite them, and will make of thee a greater nation, and mightier then they.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And Moses said vnto the Lord, Then the Egyptians shall heare it, (for thou broughtest vp this people in thy might from among them:)
\p
\v 14 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they haue heard that thou Lord art among this people, that thou Lord art seene face to face, and that thy cloud standeth ouer them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.
\p
\v 15 ¶ Now if thou shalt kill all this people, as one man, then the nations which haue heard the fame of thee, will speake, saying,
\p
\v 16 Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the lande which he sware vnto them, therefore he hath slaine them in the wildernesse.
\p
\v 17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
\p
\v 18 The Lord is long suffering, and of great mercie, forgiuing iniquitie and transgression, and by no meanes clearing the guiltie, visiting the iniquity of the fathers vpon the chldren, vnto the third and fourth generation.
\p
\v 19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquitie of this people, according vnto the greatnesse of thy mercie, and as thou hast forgiuen this people, from Egypt, euen vntill now.
\p
\v 20 And the Lord said, I haue pardoned, according to thy word.
\p
\v 21 But as truly as I liue, all the earth shalbe filled with the glory of the Lord.
\p
\v 22 Because all those men which haue seene my glory, and my miracles which I did in Egypt, and in the wildernesse, and haue tempted mee now these ten times, and haue not hearkened to my voice,
\p
\v 23 Surely they shall not see the land which I sware vnto their fathers, neither shall any of them that prouoked me, see it.
\p
\v 24 But my seruant Caleb, because hee had another spirit with him, (and hath followed mee fully) him will I bring into the land, whereinto he went, and his seed shall possesse it.
\p
\v 25 (Now the Amalekites, and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley) to morrow turne you and get you into the wildernesse, by the way of the Red sea.
\p
\v 26 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, and vnto Aaron, saying,
\p
\v 27 How long shall I beare with this euil congregation which murmure against mee? I haue heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmure against mee.
\p
\v 28 Say vnto them, As truly as I liue, saith the Lord, as ye haue spoken in mine eares, so will I doe to you:
\p
\v 29 Your carcases shall fall in this wildernesse, and all that were numbred of you, according to your whole number from twentie yeeres old and vpward, which haue murmured against mee,
\p
\v 30 Doubtlesse ye shall not come into the land concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun.
\p
\v 31 But your little ones, which yee said should be a pray, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye haue despised.
\p
\v 32 But as for you, your carkases, they shall fall in this wildernesse.
\p
\v 33 And your children shall wander in the wildernes forty yeres, and beare your whoredomes, vntill your carkases be wasted in the wildernesse.
\p
\v 34 After the number of the dayes in which ye searched the land, euen fortie dayes (each day for a yeere) shall yee beare your iniquities, euen forty yeeres, and yee shall know my breach of promise.
\p
\v 35 I the Lord haue said, I will surely doe it vnto all this euill Congregation, that are gathered together against mee: in this wildernesse they shalbe consumed, & there they shall die.
\p
\v 36 And the men which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the Congregation to murmure against him, by bringing vp a slander vpon the land,
\p
\v 37 Euen those men that did bring vp the euill report vpon the land, died by the plague, before the Lord.
\p
\v 38 But Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, liued still.
\p
\v 39 And Moses told these sayings vnto all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.
\p
\v 40 ¶ And they rose vp early in the morning, and gate them vp into the top of the mountaine, saying, Loe, we be here, and will goe vp vnto the place which the Lord hath promised: for we haue sinned.
\p
\v 41 And Moses said, Wherefore now doe you transgresse the commaundement of the Lord ? but it shall not prosper.
\p
\v 42 Goe not vp, for the Lord is not among you, that ye be not smitten before your enemies.
\p
\v 43 For the Amalekites, and the Canaanites are there before you, and yee shall fall by the sword, because yee are turned away from the Lord; therefore the Lord will not bee with you.
\p
\v 44 But they presumed to go vp vnto the hill top: neuertheles the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord, and Moses departed not out of the campe.
\p
\v 45 Then the Amalekites came downe, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, euen vnto Hormah.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I giue vnto you,
\p
\v 3 And will make an offering by fire vnto the Lord, a burnt offering or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a free will offering, or in your solemne feasts, to make a sweet sauour vnto the Lord, of the herd or of the flocke:
\p
\v 4 Then shall he that offereth his offering vnto the Lord, bring a meat offring of a tenth deale of flowre, mingled with the fourth part of an Hyn of oyle.
\p
\v 5 And the fourth part of an Hyn of wine for a drinke offring shalt thou prepare, with the burnt offering or sacrifice for one lambe.
\p
\v 6 Or for a ramme, thou shalt prepare for a meate offering two tenth deales of flowre mingled with the third part of an Hyn of oyle.
\p
\v 7 And for a drinke offering, thou shalt offer the third part of an Hyn of wine, for a sweete sauour vnto the Lord.
\p
\v 8 And when thou preparest a bullocke for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings vnto the Lord:
\p
\v 9 Then shall hee bring with a bullocke a meate offering of three tenth deales of flowre, mingled with halfe an Hyn of oyle.
\p
\v 10 And thou shalt bring for a drinke offering halfe an Hyn of wine, for an offering made by fire of a sweet sauour vnto the Lord.
\p
\v 11 Thus shall it be done for one bullocke, or for one ramme, or for a lambe, or a kidde.
\p
\v 12 According to the number that yee shall prepare, so shall yee doe to euery one, according to their number.
\p
\v 13 All that are borne of the countrey shall doe these things after this maner, in offering an offering made by fire of a sweet sauour, vnto the Lord.
\p
\v 14 And if a stranger soiourne with you, or whosoeuer bee among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweete sauour vnto the Lord: as ye doe, so hee shall doe.
\p
\v 15 One ordinance shall be both for you of the Congregation, and also for the stranger that soiourneth with you, an ordinance for euer in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger bee, before the Lord.
\p
\v 16 One law, and one maner shall be for you, and for the stranger that soiourneth with you.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 18 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,
\p
\v 19 Then it shall be that when ye eate of the bread of the land, yee shall offer vp an heaue offring vnto the Lord.
\p
\v 20 Ye shall offer vp a cake of the first of your dough, for an heaue offring: as ye doe the heaue offering of the threshing floore, so shall ye heaue it.
\p
\v 21 Of the first of your dough ye shal giue vnto the Lord, an heaue offering in your generations.
\p
\v 22 ¶ And if yee haue erred, and not obserued all these Commaundements which the Lord hath spoken vnto Moses,
\p
\v 23 Euen all that the Lord hath commanded you, by the hand of Moses from the day that the Lord commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations:
\p
\v 24 Then it shalbe, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the Congregation, that all the Congregation shall offer one yong bullocke for a burnt offering, for a sweet sauour vnto the Lord, with his meate offering, and his drinke offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sinne offering.
\p
\v 25 And the Priest shall make an atonement for all the Congregation of the children of Israel, and it shal be forgiuen them, for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offring, a sacrifice made by fire vnto the Lord, and their sinne offering before the Lord, for their ignorance.
\p
\v 26 And it shall bee forgiuen all the Congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that soiourneth among them, seeing all the people were in ignorance.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And if any soule sinne through ignorance, then hee shall bring a shee goat of the first yeere for a sinne offring.
\p
\v 28 And the Priest shall make an atonement for the soule that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord, to make an atonement for him, & it shalbe forgiuen him.
\p
\v 29 You shall haue one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is borne amongst the children of Israel, and for the stranger that soiourneth among them.
\p
\v 30 ¶ But the soule that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be borne in the land, or a stranger, the same reprocheth the Lord: and that soule shall be cut off from among his people.
\p
\v 31 Because he hath despised the word of the Lord, and hath broken his commandement, that soule shall vtterly be cut off: his iniquitie shall be vpon him.
\p
\v 32 ¶ And while the children of Israel were in the wildernes, they found a man that gathered stickes vpon the Sabbath day.
\p
\v 33 And they that found him gathering sticks, brought him vnto Moses and Aaron, and vnto all the Congregation.
\p
\v 34 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.
\p
\v 35 And the Lord said vnto Moses, The man shall bee surely put to death: all the Congregation shall stone him with stones without the campe.
\p
\v 36 And all the Cogregation brought him without the campe, and stoned him with stones, and he died, as the Lord commanded Moses.
\p
\v 37 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 38 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and bidde them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments, throughout their generations, and that they put vpon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blew.
\p
\v 39 And it shall bee vnto you for a fringe, that ye may looke vpon it, and remember all the commandements of the Lord, and doe them: and that ye seeke not after your owne heart, and your owne eyes, after which ye vse to goe a whoring:
\p
\v 40 That ye may remember, and doe all my commandements, and be holy vnto your God.
\p
\v 41 I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to bee your God: I am the Lord your God.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 Now Korah the sonne of Izhar, the sonne of Kohath, the sonne of Leui, and Dathan, and Abiram the sonnes of Eliab, and On the sonne of Peleth, sonnes of Reuben, tooke men.
\p
\v 2 And they rose vp before Moses, with certaine of the children of Israel, two hundred and fiftie Princes of the assembly, famous in the Congregation, men of renowne.
\p
\v 3 And they gathered themselues together against Moses, and against Aaron, and said vnto them, Ye take too much vpon you, seeing all the Congregation are holy euery one of them, and the Lord is among them: wherfore then lift you vp your selues aboue the Congregation of the Lord ?
\p
\v 4 And when Moses heard it, he fell vpon his face.
\p
\v 5 And hee spake vnto Korah, and vnto all his company, saying, Euen to morrow the Lord will shew who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come neere vnto him: euen him whom he hath chosen, will he cause to come neere vnto him.
\p
\v 6 This doe: take you censers, Korah, and all his company:
\p
\v 7 And put fire therein, and put incense in them, before the Lord to morrow; And it shall be, that the man whom the Lord doeth choose, hee shall be holy: yee take too much vpon you, ye sonnes of Leui.
\p
\v 8 And Moses saide vnto Korah, Heare, I pray you, ye sonnes of Leui.
\p
\v 9 Seemeth it but a small thing vnto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the Congregation of Israel, to bring you neere to himselfe, to doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the Congregation to minister vnto them?
\p
\v 10 And he hath brought thee neere to him, and all thy brethren the sonnes of Leui with thee: and seeke ye the Priesthood also?
\p
\v 11 For which cause both thou, and all thy company are gathered together against the Lord: and what is Aaron, that ye murmure against him?
\p
\v 12 ¶ And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sonnes of Eliab: which said, We will not come vp.
\p
\v 13 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought vs vp out of a land that floweth with milke and hony, to kill vs in the wildernesse, except thou make thy selfe altogether a prince ouer vs?
\p
\v 14 Moreouer, thou hast not brought vs into a land that floweth with milke and hony, or giuen vs inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come vp.
\p
\v 15 And Moses was very wroth, and said vnto the Lord, Respect not thou their offering: I haue not taken one asse from them, neither haue I hurt one of them.
\p
\v 16 And Moses said vnto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the Lord, thou, and they, and Aaron to morrow.
\p
\v 17 And take euery man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring yee before the Lord euery man his censer, two hundred and fiftie censers, thou also and Aaron, each of you his censer.
\p
\v 18 And they tooke euery man his censer, and put fire in them, and laide incense thereon, and stood in the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation with Moses and Aaron.
\p
\v 19 And Korah gathered all the Congregation against them, vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and the glory of the Lord appeared vnto all the Congregation.
\p
\v 20 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, and vnto Aaron, saying,
\p
\v 21 Separate your selues from among this Congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
\p
\v 22 And they fell vpon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shal one man sinne, and wilt thou be wroth with all the Congregation?
\p
\v 23 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 24 Speake vnto the Congregation, saying, Get you vp from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
\p
\v 25 And Moses rose vp, and went vnto Dathan and Abiram: and the Elders of Israel followed him.
\p
\v 26 And hee spake vnto the Congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sinnes.
\p
\v 27 So they gate vp from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on euery side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the doore of their tents, and their wiues, & their sonnes, and their little children.
\p
\v 28 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to doe all these workes: for I haue not done them of mine owne mind.
\p
\v 29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men, then the Lord hath not sent me:
\p
\v 30 But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them vp, with all that appertaine vnto them, and they go downe quicke into the pit: then ye shall vnderstand that these men haue prouoked the Lord.
\p
\v 31 ¶ And it came to passe as he had made an ende of speaking all these words, that the ground claue asunder that was vnder them:
\p
\v 32 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them vp, and their houses, and all the men that appertained vnto Korah, and all their goods.
\p
\v 33 They, and all that appertained to them, went downe aliue into the pit, and the earth closed vpon them: and they perished from among the Congregation.
\p
\v 34 And all Israel that were round about them, fled at the crie of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow vs vp also.
\p
\v 35 And there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fiftie men that offered incense.
\p
\v 36 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 37 Speake vnto Eleazar the sonne of Aaron the Priest, that he take vp the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder, for they are hallowed.
\p
\v 38 The censers of these sinners against their owne soules, let them make them broad plates for a couering of the Altar: for they offered them before the Lord, therefore they are hallowed, and they shall be a signe vnto the children of Israel.
\p
\v 39 And Eleazar the Priest tooke the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered, and they were made broad plates for a couering of the Altar:
\p
\v 40 To bee a memoriall vnto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come neere to offer incense before the Lord, that he be not as Korah, and as his company, as the Lord said to him by the hand of Moses.
\p
\v 41 ¶ But on the morrow, all the Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye haue killed the people of the Lord.
\p
\v 42 And it came to passe when the Congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and behold, the cloud couered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.
\p
\v 43 And Moses and Aaron came before the Tabernacle of the Congregation.
\p
\v 44 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 45 Get you vp from among this Congregation, that I may consume them, as in a moment: and they fell vpon their faces.
\p
\v 46 ¶ And Moses said vnto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the Altar, and put on incense, and goe quickly vnto the Congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the Lord; the plague is begun.
\p
\v 47 And Aaron tooke as Moses commanded, and ranne into the midst of the Congregation: and behold, the plague was begun among the people, and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
\p
\v 48 And he stood betweene the dead and the liuing, and the plague was stayed.
\p
\v 49 Now they that died in the plague, were foureteene thousand and seuen hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.
\p
\v 50 And Aaron returned vnto Moses, vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation; and the plague was stayed.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and take of euery one of them a rod, according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes, according to the house of their fathers, twelue rods: write thou euery mans name vpon his rodde.
\p
\v 3 And thou shalt write Aarons name vpon the rod of Leui: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.
\p
\v 4 And thou shalt lay them vp in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before the Testimony, where I will meet with you.
\p
\v 5 And it shall come to passe, that the mans rod whom I shall choose, shall blossome: and I will make to cease from mee the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmure against you.
\p
\v 6 ¶ And Moses spake vnto the children of Israel, and euery one of their Princes gaue him a rod a piece, for each Prince one, according to their fathers houses, euen twelue rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
\p
\v 7 And Moses layd vp the rods before the Lord, in the Tabernacle of Witnesse.
\p
\v 8 And it came to passe that on the morrow Moses went into the Tabernacle of Witnesse, and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Leui was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossomes, and yeelded almonds.
\p
\v 9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord, vnto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and tooke euery man his rod.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the Lord said vnto Moses, Bring Aarons rod againe before the Testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels, and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.
\p
\v 11 And Moses did so: as the Lord commanded him, so did he.
\p
\v 12 And the children of Israel spake vnto Moses, saying, Behold, wee die, we perish, we all perish.
\p
\v 13 Whosoeuer commeth any thing neere vnto the Tabernacle of the Lord, shall die: Shall wee be consumed with dying?

\c 18
\p
\v 1 And the Lord sayd vnto Aaron, Thou and thy sonnes, and thy fathers house with thee, shall beare the iniquitie of the Sanctuary: and thou and thy sonnes with thee, shall beare the iniquitie of your Priesthood.
\p
\v 2 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Leui, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be ioyned vnto thee, and minister vnto thee: but thou and thy sonnes with thee shall minister before the Tabernacle of Witnesse.
\p
\v 3 And they shall keepe thy charge, and the charge of all the Tabernacle: onely they shall not come nigh the vessels of the Sanctuarie, and the Altar, that neither they, nor you also die.
\p
\v 4 And they shall bee ioyned vnto thee, and keepe the charge of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, for all the seruice of the Tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh vnto you.
\p
\v 5 And yee shall keepe the charge of the Sanctuary, and the charge of the Altar, that there be no wrath any more vpon the children of Israel.
\p
\v 6 And I, beholde, I haue taken your brethren the Leuites from among the children of Israel: to you they are giuen as a gift for the Lord, to doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.
\p
\v 7 Therefore thou and thy sonnes with thee, shall keepe your Priests office for euery thing of the Altar, and within the Uaile, and yee shall serue: I haue giuen your Priests office vnto you, as a seruice of gift: and the stranger that commeth nigh, shall bee put to death.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Aaron, Behold, I also haue giuen thee the charge of mine heaue offerings, of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel, vnto thee haue I giuen them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sonnes by an ordinance for euer.
\p
\v 9 This shall bee thine of the most holy things, reserued from the fire: euery oblation of theirs, euery meat offering of theirs, and euery sinne offering of theirs, and euery trespasse offering of theirs, which they shal render vnto me, shall be most holy for thee, and for thy sonnes.
\p
\v 10 In the most holy place shalt thou eate it, euery male shall eate it: it shall be holy vnto thee.
\p
\v 11 And this is thine: the heaue offering of their gift, with all the waue offrings of the children of Israel: I haue giuen them vnto thee, & to thy sonnes, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for euer: euery one that is cleane in thy house, shall eate of it.
\p
\v 12 All the best of the oyle, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first fruits of them which they shall offer vnto the Lord, them haue I giuen thee.
\p
\v 13 And whatsoeuer is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring vnto the Lord, shall be thine, euery one that is cleane in thine house, shall eat of it.
\p
\v 14 Euery thing deuoted in Israel, shall be thine.
\p
\v 15 Euery thing that openeth the matrice in all flesh, which they bring vnto the Lord, whether it bee of men or beasts, shall be thine: Neuertheles the first borne of man shalt thou surely redeeme, and the firstling of vncleane beasts shalt thou redeeme.
\p
\v 16 And those that are to be redeemed, from a moneth old shalt thou redeeme according to thine estimation, for the money of fiue shekels, after the shekel of the Sanctuary, which is twentie gerahs.
\p
\v 17 But the firstling of a cowe, or the firstling of a sheepe, or the firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeeme, they are holy: thou shalt sprinckle their blood vpon the Altar, and shalt burne their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet sauour vnto the Lord.
\p
\v 18 And the flesh of them shall bee thine: as the waue breast, and as the right shoulder are thine.
\p
\v 19 All the heaue offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer vnto the Lord, haue I giuen thee and thy sonnes, and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for euer: it is a couenant of salt for euer, before the Lord vnto thee, and to thy seed with thee.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Aaron, Thou shalt haue no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou haue any part among them: I am thy part, and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.
\p
\v 21 And behold, I haue giuen the children of Leui all the tenth in Israel, for an inheritance, for their seruice which they serue, euen the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.
\p
\v 22 Neither must the children of Israel hencefoorth come nigh the Tabernacle of the Congregation, lest they beare sinne, and die.
\p
\v 23 But the Leuites shall doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and they shal beare their iniquitie: it shall be a statute for euer throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they haue no inheritance.
\p
\v 24 But the tithes of the children of Israel which they offer as an heaue offering vnto the Lord, I haue giuen to the Leuites to inherite: therefore I haue said vnto them, Among the children of Israel they shall haue no inheritance.
\p
\v 25 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 26 Thus speake vnto the Leuites, and say vnto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes, which I haue giuen you from them for your inheritance, then ye shal offer vp an heaue offering of it for the Lord, euen a tenth part of the tithe.
\p
\v 27 And this your heaue offering shall be reckoned vnto you, as though it were the corne of the threshing floore, and as the fulnesse of the wine presse.
\p
\v 28 Thus you also shal offer an heaue offering vnto the Lord of all your tithes which ye receiue of the children of Israel, and ye shall giue thereof the Lords heaue offering to Aaron the Priest.
\p
\v 29 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer euery heaue offering of the Lord, of all the best thereof, euen the hallowed part thereof, out of it.
\p
\v 30 Therefore thou shalt say vnto them, When yee haue heaued the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted vnto the Leuites, as the encrease of the threshing floore, and as the encrease of the wine presse.
\p
\v 31 And ye shall eate it in euery place, ye and your housholds: for it is your reward for your seruice, in the Tabernacle of the Congregation.
\p
\v 32 And yee shall beare no sinne by reason of it, when ye haue heaued from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, and vnto Aaron, saying,
\p
\v 2 This is the ordinance of the Law, which the Lord hath commaunded, saying, Speake vnto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and vpon which neuer came yoke.
\p
\v 3 And ye shall giue her vnto Eleazar the Priest, that hee may bring her forth without the campe, and one shall slay her before his face.
\p
\v 4 And Eleazar the Priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinckle of her blood directly before the Tabernacle of the Congregation seuen times.
\p
\v 5 And one shall burne the heifer in his sight: her skinne, and her flesh, and her blood, with her doung, shall he burne.
\p
\v 6 And the Priest shall take Cedarwood, and hysope, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
\p
\v 7 Then the Priest shall wash his clothes, and hee shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the campe, and the Priest shalbe vncleane vntill the euen.
\p
\v 8 And he that burneth her, shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be vncleane vntill the Euen.
\p
\v 9 And a man that is cleane, shall gather vp the ashes of the heifer, and lay them vp without the campe in a cleane place, and it shall bee kept for the Congregation of the children of Israel, for a water of separation: it is a purification for sinne.
\p
\v 10 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer, shall wash his clothes, and be vncleane vntil the Euen: and it shall be vnto the children of Israel, and vnto the stranger that soiourneth among them, for a statute for euer.
\p
\v 11 ¶ He that toucheth the dead body of any man, shall bee vncleane seuen dayes.
\p
\v 12 He shall purifie himselfe with it on the third day, and on the seuenth day he shall be cleane: but if he purifie not himselfe the third day, then the seuenth day he shall not be cleane.
\p
\v 13 Whosoeuer toucheth the dead bodie of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himselfe, defileth the Tabernacle of the Lord, and that soule shall be cut off from Israel, because the water of separation was not sprinckled vpon him: he shall be vncleane, his vncleannesse is yet vpon him.
\p
\v 14 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent; all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shalbe vnclean seuen dayes.
\p
\v 15 And euery open vessel which hath no couering bound vpon it, is vncleane.
\p
\v 16 And whosoeuer toucheth one that is slaine with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a graue, shall be vncleane seuen dayes.
\p
\v 17 And for an vncleane person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sinne, and running water shall bee put thereto in a vessell:
\p
\v 18 And a cleane person shall take hysope, and dippe it in the water, and sprinckle it vpon the tent, and vpon all the vessels, and vpon the persons that were there, and vpon him that touched a bone, or one slaine, or one dead, or a graue.
\p
\v 19 And the cleane person shal sprinkle vpon the vncleane on the third day, and on the seuenth day: and on the seuenth day he shall purifie himselfe, and wash his clothes, and bathe himselfe in water, and shall be cleane at Euen.
\p
\v 20 But the man that shall bee vncleane, and shall not purifie himselfe, that soule shall bee cut off from among the Congregation: because he hath defiled the Sanctuary of the Lord, the water of separation hath not beene sprinkled vpon him, he is vncleane.
\p
\v 21 And it shall be a perpetuall statute vnto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation, shall wash his clothes: and he that toucheth the water of separation, shall be vncleane vntill Euen.
\p
\v 22 And whatsoeuer the vncleane person toucheth, shall be vncleane: and the soule that toucheth it, shall bee vncleane vntill Euen.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 Then came the children of Israel, euen the whole Congregation, into the desert of Zin, in the first moneth: and the people abode in Kadesh, and Miriam died there, and was buried there.
\p
\v 2 And there was no water for the Congregation: and they gathered themselues together against Moses and against Aaron.
\p
\v 3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the Lord.
\p
\v 4 And why haue yee brought vp the Congregation of the Lord into this wildernesse, that we and our cattell should die there?
\p
\v 5 And wherefore haue ye made vs to come vp out of Egypt, to bring vs in vnto this euil place? it is no place of seed, or of figges, or vines, or of pomegranates, neither is there any water to drinke.
\p
\v 6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly, vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell vpon their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared vnto them.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 8 Take the rodde, and gather thou the assembly together, thou and Aaron thy brother, and speake yee vnto the rocke before their eyes, and it shall giue foorth his water, and thou shalt bring foorth to them, water out of the rocke: so thou shalt giue the Congregation, and their beasts drinke.
\p
\v 9 And Moses tooke the rod from before the Lord, as he commanded him.
\p
\v 10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the Congregation together before the rocke, and hee said vnto them, Heare now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rocke?
\p
\v 11 And Moses lift vp his hand, and with his rod he smote the rocke twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the Congregation dranke, and their beasts also.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses and Aaron, Because ye beleeue me not, to sanctifie me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this Congregation into the land which I haue giuen them.
\p
\v 13 This is the water of Meribah, because the children of Israel stroue with the Lord; and he was sanctified in them.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh, vnto the King of Edom; Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the trauaile that hath befallen vs:
\p
\v 15 How our fathers went downe into Egypt, and we haue dwelt in Egypt a long time: and the Egyptians vexed vs, and our fathers.
\p
\v 16 And when wee cryed vnto the Lord, he heard our voyce, and sent an Angel, and hath brought vs foorth out of Egypt: and behold, wee are in Kadesh, a citie in the vttermost of thy border.
\p
\v 17 Let vs passe, I pray thee, thorow thy countrey: we will not passe thorow the fields, or thorow the Uineyards, neither will we drinke of the water of the wells: wee will goe by the Kings high-way, we wil not turne to the right hand nor to the left, vntill wee haue passed thy borders.
\p
\v 18 And Edom said vnto him, Thou shalt not passe by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.
\p
\v 19 And the children of Israel said vnto him, We will goe by the high-way: and if I and my cattell drinke of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will onely (without doing any thing else) go thorow on my feet.
\p
\v 20 And he said, Thou shalt not goe thorow. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
\p
\v 21 Thus Edom refused to giue Israel passage thorow his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.
\p
\v 22 ¶ And the children of Israel, euen the whole Congregation, iourneyed from Kadesh, and came vnto mount Hor.
\p
\v 23 And the Lord spake vnto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying;
\p
\v 24 Aaron shall bee gathered vnto his people: for hee shall not enter into the land which I haue giuen vnto the children of Israel, because yee rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.
\p
\v 25 Take Aaron, and Eleazar his sonne, and bring them vp vnto mount Hor.
\p
\v 26 And strippe Aaron of his garments, and put them vpon Eleazar his sonne, and Aaron shall be gathered vnto his people, and shall die there.
\p
\v 27 And Moses did as the Lord commaunded: and they went vp into mount Hor, in the sight of all the Congregation.
\p
\v 28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them vpon Eleazar his sonne, and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came downe from the mount.
\p
\v 29 And when all the Congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty dayes, euen all the house of Israel.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies, then hee fought against Israel, and tooke some of them prisoners.
\p
\v 2 And Israel vowed a vow vnto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt in deed deliuer this people into my hand, then I wil vtterly destroy their cities.
\p
\v 3 And the Lord hearkened to the voyce of Israel, and deliuered vp the Canaanites: and they vtterly destroyed them, and their cities, and hee called the name of the place Hormah.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And they iourneyed from mount Hor, by the way of the red sea, to compasse the land of Edom: and the soule of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
\p
\v 5 And the people spake against God and against Moses, Wherefore haue ye brought vs vp out of Egypt, to die in the wildernesse? for there is no bread, neither is there any water, and our soule loatheth this light bread.
\p
\v 6 And the Lord sent fierie serpents among the people, and they bit the people, and much people of Israel died.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We haue sinned: for wee haue spoken against the Lord, and against thee: pray vnto the Lord that hee take away the serpents from vs: and Moses prayed for the people.
\p
\v 8 And the Lord said vnto Moses, Make thee a fierie serpent, and set it vpon a pole: and it shall come to passe, that euery one that is bitten, when hee looketh vpon it, shall liue.
\p
\v 9 And Moses made a serpent of brasse, and put it vpon a pole, and it came to passe, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when hee beheld the serpent of brasse, he liued.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.
\p
\v 11 And they iourneyed from Oboth, and pitched at Iie-Abarim, in the wildernes which is before Moab, toward the Sunne rising.
\p
\v 12 ¶ From thence they remooued, and pitched in the valley of Zared.
\p
\v 13 From thence they remooued, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wildernesse that commeth out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, betweene Moab and the Amorites.
\p
\v 14 Wherefore it is said in the booke of the warres of the Lord, what he did in the Red sea, and in the brookes of Arnon,
\p
\v 15 And at the streame of the brookes that goeth downe to the dwelling of Ar, & lieth vpon the border of Moab.
\p
\v 16 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the Lord spake vnto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will giue them water.
\p
\v 17 ¶ Then Israel sang this song, Spring vp O well, Sing ye vnto it:
\p
\v 18 The Princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the Law-giuer, with their staues. And from the wildernesse they went to Mattanah:
\p
\v 19 And from Mattanah, to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:
\p
\v 20 And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the countrey of Moab, to the toppe of Pisgah, which looketh toward Ieshimon.
\p
\v 21 ¶ And Israel sent messengers vnto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
\p
\v 22 Let me passe thorow thy land, we will not turne into the fields, or into the vineyards, we will not drinke of the waters of the well: but we will goe along by the kings high way, vntill wee be past thy borders.
\p
\v 23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to passe thorow his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wildernes: and he came to Iahaz, and fought against Israel.
\p
\v 24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon vnto Iabok, euen vnto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.
\p
\v 25 And Israel tooke all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.
\p
\v 26 For Heshbon was the citie of Sihon the King of the Amorites, who had fought against the former King of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, euen vnto Arnon.
\p
\v 27 Wherefore they that speake in prouerbes, say, Come into Heshbon: let the citie of Sihon bee built and prepared.
\p
\v 28 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the citie of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lordes of the high places of Arnon.
\p
\v 29 Woe to thee, Moab, thou art vndone, O people of Chemosh: he hath giuen his sonnes that escaped, and his daughters, into captiuitie vnto Sihon King of the Amorites.
\p
\v 30 We haue shot at them; Heshbon is perished euen vnto Dibon, and we haue layde them waste euen vnto Nophah, which reacheth vnto Medeba.
\p
\v 31 ¶ Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
\p
\v 32 And Moses sent to spy out Iaazer, and they tooke the villages thereof, and droue out the Amorites that were there.
\p
\v 33 ¶ And they turned and went vp by the way of Bashan: and Og the King of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battell at Edrei.
\p
\v 34 And the Lord said vnto Moses, Feare him not: for I haue deliuered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land, and thou shalt doe to him as thou didst vnto Sihon King of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
\p
\v 35 So they smote him & his sonnes, and all his people, vntill there was none left him aliue, and they possessed his land.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plaines of Moab, on this side Iordane by Iericho.
\p
\v 2 ¶ And Balak the sonne of Zippor, saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
\p
\v 3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many, and Moab was distressed, because of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 4 And Moab said vnto the elders of Midian; Now shall this company licke vp all that are round about vs, as the oxe licketh vp the grasse of the field. And Balak the sonne of Zippor, was King of the Moabites at that time.
\p
\v 5 He sent messengers therefore vnto Balaam the sonne of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the riuer of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: beholde, they couer the face of the earth, and they abide ouer against me.
\p
\v 6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse mee this people, for they are too mightie for me: peraduenture I shall preuaile, that we may smite them, and that I may driue them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest, is blessed, and hee whom thou cursest, is cursed.
\p
\v 7 And the elders of Moab, and the elders of Midian departed, with the rewards of diuination in their hand; and they came vnto Balaam, and spake vnto him the words of Balak.
\p
\v 8 And hee said vnto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word againe as the Lord shal speake vnto mee: and the Princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
\p
\v 9 And God came vnto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?
\p
\v 10 And Balaam said vnto God, Balak the sonne of Zippor, King of Moab, hath sent vnto me, saying;
\p
\v 11 Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which couereth the face of the earth: Come now, curse me them; peraduenture I shalbe able to ouercome them, and driue them out.
\p
\v 12 And God saide vnto Balaam; Thou shalt not goe with them, thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.
\p
\v 13 And Balaam rose vp in the morning, and said vnto the Princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the Lord refuseth to giue mee leaue to goe with you.
\p
\v 14 And the Princes of Moab rose vp, and they went vnto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with vs.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And Balak sent yet againe Princes, moe, and more honourable then they.
\p
\v 16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor; Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from comming vnto me:
\p
\v 17 For I wil promote thee vnto very great honour, and I will do whatsoeuer thou saiest vnto me: Come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.
\p
\v 18 And Balaam answered and said vnto the seruants of Balak, If Balak would giue me his house full of siluer and gold, I cannot goe beyond the word of the Lord my God, to doe lesse or more.
\p
\v 19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarie yee also here this night, that I may know what the Lord will say vnto me more.
\p
\v 20 And God came vnto Balaam at night, and said vnto him, If the men come to call thee, rise vp, and goe with them: but yet the word which I shall say vnto thee, that shalt thou doe.
\p
\v 21 And Balaam rose vp in the morning, and sadled his asse, and went with the princes of Moab.
\p
\v 22 ¶ And Gods anger was kindled, because he went: and the Angel of the Lord stood in the way for an aduersarie against him: Now he was riding vpon his asse, and his two seruants were with him.
\p
\v 23 And the Asse sawe the Angel of the Lord standing in the way, and his sword drawen in his hand: and the asse turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the asse, to turne her into the way.
\p
\v 24 But the Angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, & a wall on that side.
\p
\v 25 And when the asse saw the Angel of the Lord, she thrust her selfe vnto the wall, and crusht Balaams foote against the wall: and hee smote her againe.
\p
\v 26 And the Angel of the Lord went further, and stood in a narrowe place, where was no way to turne, either to the right hand, or to the left.
\p
\v 27 And when the asse sawe the Angel of the Lord, shee fell downe vnder Balaam, and Balaams anger was kindled, and hee smote the asse with a staffe.
\p
\v 28 And the Lord opened the mouth of the asse, and shee saide vnto Balaam, What haue I done vnto thee, that thou hast smitten mee these three times?
\p
\v 29 And Balaam said vnto the asse, Because thou hast mocked mee: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.
\p
\v 30 And the asse said vnto Balaam, Am not I thine asse, vpon which thou hast ridden euer since I was thine, vnto this day? was I euer wont to do so vnto thee? And he said, Nay.
\p
\v 31 Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and hee saw the Angel of the Lord standing in the way, and his sword drawen in his hand: and hee bowed downe his head, and fell flat on his face.
\p
\v 32 And the Angel of the Lord said vnto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine asse these three times? Behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is peruerse before me.
\p
\v 33 And the asse saw me, and turned from me these three times: vnlesse shee had turned from me, surely now also I had slaine thee, and saued her aliue.
\p
\v 34 And Balaam said vnto the Angel of the Lord, I haue sinned: for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against mee: Now therefore if it displease thee, I will get mee backe againe.
\p
\v 35 And the Angel of the Lord said vnto Balaam, Goe with the men: but onely the word that I shall speake vnto thee, that thou shalt speake: So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
\p
\v 36 ¶ And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, hee went out to meete him, vnto a citie of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the vtmost coast.
\p
\v 37 And Balak said vnto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send vnto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not vnto me? Am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?
\p
\v 38 And Balaam saide vnto Balak, Loe, I am come vnto thee: haue I now any power at all to say any thing? the worde that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speake.
\p
\v 39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came vnto Kiriath-Huzoth.
\p
\v 40 And Balak offered oxen, and sheepe, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.
\p
\v 41 And it came to passe on the morrow, that Balak tooke Balaam, and brought him vp into the high places of Baal, that thence hee might see the vtmost part of the people.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 And Balaam saide vnto Balak, Build me here seuen Altars, and prepare mee here seuen oxen, and seuen rammes.
\p
\v 2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken, and Balak & Balaam offered on euery altar a bullocke and a ramme.
\p
\v 3 And Balaam said vnto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offring, and I wil goe: peraduenture the Lord will come to meete mee; and whatsoeuer he sheweth me, I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.
\p
\v 4 And God met Balaam, and he said vnto him, I haue prepared seuen altars, and I haue offered vpon euery altar a bullocke and a ramme.
\p
\v 5 And the Lord put a word in Balaams mouth, and said, Returne vnto Balak, & thus thou shalt speake.
\p
\v 6 And he returned vnto him, and loe, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, hee, and all the Princes of Moab.
\p
\v 7 And he tooke vp his parable, and said, Balak the King of Moab hath brought mee from Aram, out of the mountaines of the East, saying, Come, curse me Iacob, and come, defie Israel.
\p
\v 8 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defie, whom the Lord hath not defied?
\p
\v 9 For from the top of the rockes I see him, and from the hilles I behold him: loe, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not bee reckoned among the nations.
\p
\v 10 Who can count the dust of Iacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let mee die the death of the righteous, & let my last end be like his.
\p
\v 11 And Balak saide vnto Balaam, What hast thou done vnto me? I tooke thee to curse mine enemies, and behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.
\p
\v 12 And he answered, and said, Must I not take heede to speake that which the Lord hath put in my mouth?
\p
\v 13 And Balak said vnto him, Come, I pray thee, with me, vnto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the vtmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And hee brought him into the fielde of Zophim, to the toppe of Pisgah, and built seuen altars, and offered a bullocke and a ramme on euery altar.
\p
\v 15 And he said vnto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meete the Lord yonder.
\p
\v 16 And the Lord met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and saide, Goe againe vnto Balak, and say thus.
\p
\v 17 And when hee came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offring, and the Princes of Moab with him. And Balak said vnto him, What hath the Lord spoken?
\p
\v 18 And he tooke vp his parable, and said, Rise vp Balak, & heare; hearken vnto me, thou sonne of Zippor:
\p
\v 19 God is not a man that he should lie, neither the sonne of man, that hee should repent: hath he said, and shall he not doe it? or, hath hee spoken, and shall he not make it good?
\p
\v 20 Behold, I haue receiued commandement to blesse: and hee hath blessed, and I cannot reuerse it.
\p
\v 21 Hee hath not beheld iniquitie in Iacob, neither hath he seene peruersenesse in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the shoute of a King is among them.
\p
\v 22 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an Unicorne.
\p
\v 23 Surely there is no inchantment against Iacob, neither is there any diuination against Israel: according to this time it shalbe said of Iacob, and of Israel, What hath God wrought!
\p
\v 24 Beholde, the people shall rise vp as a great Lion, and lift vp himselfe as a yong Lion: hee shall not lie downe vntill he eate of the pray, and drinke the blood of the slaine.
\p
\v 25 ¶ And Balak said vnto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor blesse them at all.
\p
\v 26 But Balaam answered, and said vnto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the Lord speaketh, that I must doe?
\p
\v 27 ¶ And Balak saide vnto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee vnto another place, peraduenture it will please God, that thou mayest curse me them from thence.
\p
\v 28 And Balak brought Balaam vnto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Ieshimon.
\p
\v 29 And Balaam saide vnto Balak, Build mee here seuen altars, and prepare me here seuen bullocks, and seuen rammes.
\p
\v 30 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offred a bullocke and a ramme on euery altar.

\c 24
\p
\v 1 And when Balaam sawe that it pleased the Lord to blesse Israel, hee went not, as at other times to seeke for inchantments, but hee set his face toward the wildernesse.
\p
\v 2 And Balaam lift vp his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents, according to their Tribes: and the Spirit of God came vpon him.
\p
\v 3 And he tooke vp his parable, and said, Balaam the sonne of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:
\p
\v 4 Hee hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almightie, falling into a trance, but hauing his eyes open:
\p
\v 5 How goodly are thy tents, O Iacob, and thy Tabernacles, O Israel!
\p
\v 6 As the valleyes are they spread forth, as gardens by the riuer side, as the trees of Lign-Aloes which the Lord hath planted, and as Cedar trees beside the waters.
\p
\v 7 He shall powre the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his King shall be higher then Agag, and his Kingdome shall be exalted.
\p
\v 8 God brought him forth out of Egypt, he hath as it were the strength of an Unicorne: he shall eate vp the nations his enemies, and shall breake their bones, and pierce them thorow with his arrowes.
\p
\v 9 Hee couched, he lay downe as a Lyon, and as a great Lyon: who shal stirre him vp? Blessed is hee that blesseth thee, and cursed is hee that curseth thee.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And Balaks anger was kindled against Balaam, and hee smote his hands together: and Balak said vnto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.
\p
\v 11 Therefore now, flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee vnto great honour, but loe, the Lord hath kept thee backe from honour.
\p
\v 12 And Balaam said vnto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest vnto me, saying,
\p
\v 13 If Balak would give mee his house full of siluer and gold, I cannot goe beyond the commandement of the Lord, to doe either good or bad of mine owne mind? But what the Lord saith, that will I speake.
\p
\v 14 And now beholde, I goe vnto my people: come therefore, and I will aduertise thee, what this people shall doe to thy people in the latter dayes.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And hee tooke vp his parable, and said, Balaam the sonne of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open, hath said:
\p
\v 16 He hath said which heard the words of God, and knewe the knowledge of the most High, which sawe the vision of the Almightie, falling into a trance, but hauing his eyes open.
\p
\v 17 I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: There shall come a starre out of Iacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.
\p

\v 37 Their meate offering, and their drinke offrings, for the bullocke, for the ramme, and for the lambes shall be according to their number, after the maner:
\p
\v 38 And one goat for a sinne offering, beside the continuall burnt offring, and his meate offering, and his drinke offering.
\p
\v 39 These things ye shall doe vnto the Lord in your set feasts, besides your vowes, and your free will offerings, for your burnt offerings, and for your meate offerings, and for your drinke offerings, and for your peace offerings.
\p
\v 40 And Moses tolde the children of Israel, according to all that the Lord commanded Moses.

\c 30
\p
\v 1 And Moses spake vnto the heads of the tribes, concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded.
\p
\v 2 If a man vowe a vow vnto the Lord, or sweare an othe to bind his soule with a bond: he shall not breake his word, hee shall doe according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.
\p
\v 3 If a woman also vow a vow vnto the Lord, and binde her selfe by a bond, being in her fathers house in her youth;
\p
\v 4 And her father heare her vow, and her bond wherewith shee hath bound her soule, and her father shall holde his peace at her: then all her vowes shall stand, and euery bond wherewith shee hath bound her soule, shall stand.
\p
\v 5 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vowes or of her bonds, wherewith she hath bound her soule, shall stand: and the Lord shall forgiue her, because her father disallowed her.
\p
\v 6 And if she had at all an husband when she vowed, or vttered ought out of her lips, wherewith shee bound her soule,
\p
\v 7 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that hee heard it: then her vowes shall stand, and her bonds wherewith shee bound her soule, shall stand.
\p
\v 8 But if her husband disallowe her on the day that he heard it, then he shall make her vowe which she vowed, and that which she vttered with her lippes wherewith shee bound her soule, of none effect, and the Lord shall forgiue her.
\p
\v 9 But euery vow of a widow, and of her that is diuorced, wherewith they haue bound their soules, shall stand against her.
\p
\v 10 And if she vowed in her husbands house, or bound her soule by a bond with an oath;
\p
\v 11 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vowes shall stand, and euery bond wherewith shee bound her soule, shall stand.
\p
\v 12 But if her husband hath vtterly made them voyd on the day hee heard them: then whatsoeuer proceeded out of her lips concerning her vowes, or concerning the bond of her soule, shall not stand: her husband hath made them voyd, and the Lord shal forgiue her.
\p
\v 13 Euery vow, and euery binding othe to afflict the soule, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it voyd.
\p
\v 14 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her, from day to day, then he establisheth all her vowes, or all her bonds which are vpon her: hee confirmeth them, because hee held his peace at her, in the day that hee heard them.
\p
\v 15 But if hee shall any wayes make them voyd after that he hath heard them, then he shall beare her iniquitie.
\p
\v 16 These are the statutes which the Lord commanded Moses betweene a man and his wife, betweene the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth, in her fathers house.

\c 31
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 2 Auenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered vnto thy people.
\p
\v 3 And Moses spake vnto the people, saying, Arme some of your selues vnto the warre, and let them goe against the Midianites, and auenge the Lord of Midian.
\p
\v 4 Of euery tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the warre.
\p
\v 5 So there were deliuered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of euery tribe, twelue thousand armed for warre.
\p
\v 6 And Moses sent them to the warre, a thousand of euery tribe, them and Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar the Priest, to the warre, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow, in his hand.
\p
\v 7 And they warred against the Midianites, as the Lord commanded Moses, and they slew all the males.
\p
\v 8 And they slew the Kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slaine; namely Eui, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, fiue Kings of Midian; Balaam also the sonne of Beor they slew with the sword.
\p
\v 9 And the children of Israel tooke all the women of Midian captiues, and their little ones, and tooke the spoile of all their cattell, and all their flocks, and all their goods.
\p
\v 10 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles with fire:
\p
\v 11 And they tooke all the spoile, and all the pray, both of men and of beasts.
\p
\v 12 And they brought the captiues, and the pray, and the spoile vnto Moses and Eleazar the Priest, and vnto the Congregation of the children of Israel, vnto the campe at the plaines of Moab, which are by Iordan neere Iericho.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And Moses and Eleazar the Priest, and all the Princes of the Congregation went foorth to meete them without the campe.
\p
\v 14 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the hoste, with the captaines ouer thousands, and captaines ouer hundreds, which came from the battel.
\p
\v 15 And Moses said vnto them, Haue ye saued all the women aliue?
\p
\v 16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsell of Balaam, to commit trespasse against the Lord in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the Congregation of the Lord.
\p
\v 17 Now therefore kill euery male among the little ones, and kill euery woman that hath knowen man, by lying with him.
\p
\v 18 But all the women children that haue not knowen a man by lying with him, keepe aliue for your selues.
\p
\v 19 And doe yee abide without the campe seuen dayes: whosoeuer hath killed any person, and whosoeuer hath touched any slaine, purifie both your selues, and your captiues, on the third day, and on the seuenth day.
\p
\v 20 And purifie all your raiment, and all that is made of skinnes, and all worke of goates haire, and all things made of wood.
\p
\v 21 ¶ And Eleazar the Priest said vnto the men of warre which went to the battell, This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord commaunded Moses.
\p
\v 22 Onely the gold, and the siluer, the brasse, the yron, the tinne, and the lead,
\p
\v 23 Euery thing that may abide the fire, yee shall make it goe through the fire, and it shall be cleane: neuerthelesse, it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire, yee shall make goe through the water.
\p
\v 24 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seuenth day, and ye shalbe cleane, and afterward yee shall come into the campe.
\p
\v 25 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 26 Take the summe of the pray, that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou and Eleazar the Priest, and the chiefe fathers of the Congregation:
\p
\v 27 And diuide the pray into two parts, betweene them that tooke the warre vpon them, who went out to battell, and betweene all the Congregation.
\p
\v 28 And leuie a tribute vnto the Lord of the men of warre which went out to battell: one soule of fiue hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeues, and of the asses, and of the sheepe.
\p
\v 29 Take it of their halfe, and giue it vnto Eleazar the Priest, for an heaue offering of the Lord.
\p
\v 30 And of the children of Israels halfe, thou shalt take one portion of fiftie, of the persons, of the beeues, of the asses, and of the flockes, of all maner of beasts, and giue them vnto the Leuites, which keepe the charge of the Tabernacle of the Lord.
\p
\v 31 And Moses and Eleazar the Priest did as the Lord commanded Moses.
\p
\v 32 And the bootie being the rest of the pray which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand, and seuenty thousand, and fiue thousand sheepe,
\p
\v 33 And threescore and twelue thousand beeues,
\p
\v 34 And threescore and one thousand asses:
\p
\v 35 And thirtie and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not knowen man by lying with him.
\p
\v 36 And the halfe which was the portion of them that went out to warre, was in number three hundred thousand, and seuen and thirtie thousand, and fiue hundred sheepe.
\p
\v 37 And the Lords tribute of the sheepe was sixe hundred and threescore and fifteene.
\p
\v 38 And the beeues were thirtie and sixe thousand, of which the Lords tribute was threescore and twelue.
\p
\v 39 And the asses were thirtie thousand and fiue hundred, of which the Lords tribute was threescore and one.
\p
\v 40 And the persons were sixteene thousand, of which the Lords tribute was thirtie and two persons.
\p
\v 41 And Moses gaue the tribute which was the Lords heaue offering, vnto Eleazar the Priest, as the Lord commanded Moses.
\p
\v 42 And of the children of Israels halfe, which Moses diuided from the men that warred:
\p
\v 43 (Now the halfe that perteined vnto the Congregation, was three hundred thousand, and thirtie thousand, and seuen thousand, and fiue hundred sheepe:
\p
\v 44 And thirtie and sixe thousand beeues:
\p
\v 45 And thirtie thousand asses, and fiue hundred:
\p
\v 46 And sixteene thousand persons)
\p
\v 47 Euen of the children of Israels halfe, Moses tooke one portion of fiftie, both of man and of beast, and gaue them vnto the Leuites, which kept the charge of the Tabernacle of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.
\p
\v 48 ¶ And the officers which were ouer thousands of the hoste, the captaines of thousands, and captaines of hundreds came neere vnto Moses.
\p
\v 49 And they said vnto Moses, Thy seruants haue taken the summe of the men of warre which are vnder our charge, and there lacketh not one man of vs.
\p
\v 50 Wee haue therefore brought an oblation for the Lord, what euerie man hath gotten, of iewels of golde chaines, and bracelets, rings, earerings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our soules before the Lord.
\p
\v 51 And Moses and Eleazar the Priest tooke the gold of them: euen all wrought iewels.
\p
\v 52 And all the gold of the offring that they offered vp to the Lord, of the captaines of thousands, and of the captaines of hundreds, was sixteene thousand, seuen hundred and fiftie shekels.
\p
\v 53 (For the men of warre had taken spoile, euery man for himselfe.)
\p
\v 54 And Moses and Eleazar the Priest tooke the gold of the captaines, of thousands, and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, for a memoriall for the children of Israel before the Lord.

\c 32
\p
\v 1 Now the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, had a very great multitude of cattell: and when they saw the land of Iazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place was a place for cattell;
\p
\v 2 The children of Gad, and the children of Reuben, came and spake vnto Moses, and to Eleazar the Priest, and vnto the Princes of the Congregation, saying,
\p
\v 3 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Iazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,
\p
\v 4 Euen the countrey which the Lord smote before the Congregation of Israel, is a land for cattell, and thy seruants haue cattell.
\p
\v 5 Wherefore, said they, if wee haue found grace in thy sight, let this lande be giuen vnto thy seruants for a possession, and bring vs not ouer Iordane.
\p
\v 6 ¶ And Moses said vnto the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren goe to warre, and shall ye sit here?
\p
\v 7 And wherefore discourage yee the heart of the children of Israel from going ouer into the lande, which the Lord hath giuen them?
\p
\v 8 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.
\p
\v 9 For when they went vp vnto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not goe into the land which the Lord had giuen them.
\p
\v 10 And the Lords anger was kindled the same time, and hee sware, saying,
\p
\v 11 Surely none of the men that came vp out of Egypt, from twentie yeeres old and vpward, shall see the lande which I sware vnto Abraham, vnto Isaac, and vnto Iacob, because they haue not wholly followed me:
\p
\v 12 Saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh the Kenezite, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun: for they haue wholly followed the Lord.
\p
\v 13 And the Lords anger was kindled against Israel, and hee made them wander in the wildernesse fourty yeeres, vntill all the generation that had done euill in the sight of the Lord was consumed.
\p
\v 14 And beholde, ye are risen vp in your fathers stead, an increase of sinfull men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel.
\p
\v 15 For if yee turne away from after him, hee will yet againe leaue them in the wildernesse, and ye shall destroy all this people.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And they came neere vnto him, and said, Wee will build sheepfoldes here for our cattell, and cities for our litle ones.
\p
\v 17 But we ourselues will goe ready armed before the children of Israel, vntill wee haue brought them vnto their place: and our litle ones shall dwell in the fenced cities, because of the inhabitants of the land.
\p
\v 18 Wee will not returne vnto our houses, vntill the children of Israel haue inherited euery man his inheritance:
\p
\v 19 For wee will not inherite with them on yonder side Iordane, or forward, because our inheritance is fallen to vs on this side Iordane Eastward.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And Moses said vnto them, If ye will doe this thing, if ye will goe armed before the Lord to warre,
\p
\v 21 And will goe all of you armed ouer Iordane before the Lord, vntill he hath driuen out his enemies from before him,
\p
\v 22 And the land bee subdued before the Lord: then afterward ye shall returne, and bee guiltlesse before the Lord, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the Lord.
\p
\v 23 But if ye will not doe so, behold, yee haue sinned against the Lord: and bee sure your sinne will finde you out.
\p
\v 24 Build ye cities for your litle ones, and folds for your sheepe, and doe that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.
\p
\v 25 And the children of Gad, and the children of Reuben spake vnto Moses, saying, Thy seruants will doe as my lord commandeth.
\p
\v 26 Our little ones, our wiues, our flocks, and all our cattell shall be there in the cities of Gilead.
\p
\v 27 But thy seruants will passe ouer, euery man armed for warre, before the Lord to battell, as my lord saith.
\p
\v 28 So concerning them Moses commaunded Eleazar the Priest, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and the chiefe fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:
\p
\v 29 And Moses said vnto them, If the children of Gad, and the children of Reuben will passe with you ouer Iordane, euery man armed to battell before the Lord, and the land shall be subdued before you, then ye shall giue them the land of Gilead for a possession:
\p
\v 30 But if they will not passe ouer with you armed, they shall haue possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
\p
\v 31 And the children of Gad, and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the Lord hath said vnto thy seruants, so will we doe.
\p
\v 32 Wee will passe ouer armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Iordane may be ours.
\p
\v 33 And Moses gaue vnto them, euen to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben; and vnto halfe the tribe of Manasseh the sonne of Ioseph, the kingdome of Sihon King of the Amorites, and the kingdome of Og King of Bashan, the land with the cities thereof, in the coastes, euen the cities of the countrey round about.
\p
\v 34 ¶ And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
\p
\v 35 And Atroth, Shophan, and Iaazer, and Iogbehah,
\p
\v 36 And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and foldes for sheepe.
\p
\v 37 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,
\p
\v 38 And Nebo, and Baalmeon (their names being changed) and Shibmah: and gaue other names vnto the cities which they builded.
\p
\v 39 And the children of Machir, the sonne of Manasseh, went to Gilead, and tooke it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.
\p
\v 40 And Moses gaue Gilead vnto Machir the sonne of Manasseh, and he dwelt therein.
\p
\v 41 And Iair the sonne of Manasseh went and tooke the small townes thereof, and called them Hauoth-Iair.
\p
\v 42 And Nobah went and tooke Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his owne name.

\c 33
\p
\v 1 These are the iourneyes of the children of Israel, which went foorth out of the land of Egypt, with their armies, vnder the hand of Moses and Aaron.
\p
\v 2 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their iourneyes, by the commandement of the Lord: and these are their iourneyes according to their goings out.
\p
\v 3 And they departed from Rameses in the first moneth, on the fifteenth day of the first moneth: on the morrow after the Passeouer, the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.
\p
\v 4 (For the Egyptians buried all their first borne, which the Lord had smitten among them: vpon their gods also the Lord executed iudgements.)
\p
\v 5 And the children of Israel remoued from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth.
\p
\v 6 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wildernesse.
\p
\v 7 And they remoued from Etham, and turned againe vnto Pihahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon: and they pitched before Migdol.
\p
\v 8 And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed thorow the midst of the sea, into the wildernes, and went three dayes iourney in the wildernesse of Etham, and pitched in Marah.
\p
\v 9 And they remoued from Marah, and came vnto Elim, and in Elim were twelue fountaines of water, and three score and ten palme trees, and they pitched there.
\p
\v 10 And they remooued from Elim, and encamped by the red sea.
\p
\v 11 And they remooued from the red sea, and encamped in the wildernesse of Sin.
\p
\v 12 And they tooke their iourney out of the wildernesse of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.
\p
\v 13 And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.
\p
\v 14 And they remoued from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drinke.
\p
\v 15 And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wildernesse of Sinai.
\p
\v 16 And they remoued from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at Kibroth Hattaauah.
\p
\v 17 And they departed from Kibroth Hattaauah, and encamped at Hazeroth.
\p
\v 18 And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.
\p
\v 19 And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmon Parez.
\p
\v 20 And they departed from Rimmon Parez, and pitched in Libnah.
\p
\v 21 And they remoued from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah.
\p
\v 22 And they iourneyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.
\p
\v 23 And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.
\p
\v 24 And they remoued from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.
\p
\v 25 And they remooued from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.
\p
\v 26 And they remooued from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.
\p
\v 27 And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.
\p
\v 28 And they remoued from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.
\p
\v 29 And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.
\p
\v 30 And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.
\p
\v 31 And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Bene-Iaakan.
\p
\v 32 And they remooued from Bene-Iaakan, & encamped at Horhagidgad.
\p
\v 33 And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Iotbathah.
\p
\v 34 And they remooued from Iotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.
\p
\v 35 And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Ezion-gaber.
\p
\v 36 And they remoued from Ezion-gaber, and pitched in the wildernes of Zin, which is Kadesh.
\p
\v 37 And they remooued from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.
\p
\v 38 And Aaron the Priest went vp into mount Hor, at the commandement of the Lord, and died there in the fourtieth yeere, after the children of Israel were come out of the lande of Egypt, in the first day of the fift moneth.
\p
\v 39 And Aaron was an hundred and twentie and three yeeres old, when hee died in mount Hor.
\p
\v 40 And King Arad the Canaanite (which dwelt in the South, in the land of Canaan) heard of the comming of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 41 And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.
\p
\v 42 And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.
\p
\v 43 And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.
\p
\v 44 And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Iie-Abarim, in the border of Moab.
\p
\v 45 And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibon Gad.
\p
\v 46 And they remoued from Dibon Gad, and encamped in Almon-Diblathaim.
\p
\v 47 And they remooued from Almon-Diblathaim, and pitched in the mountaines of Abarim, before Nebo.
\p
\v 48 And they departed from the mountaines of Abarim, and pitched in the plaines of Moab, by Iordan neere Iericho.
\p
\v 49 And they pitched by Iordane from Beth-Iesimoth, euen vnto Abel Shittim, in the plaines of Moab.
\p
\v 50 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, in the plaines of Moab by Iordane, neere Iericho, saying,
\p
\v 51 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye are passed ouer Iordane into the land of Canaan;
\p
\v 52 Then ye shall driue out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite plucke downe all their high places.
\p
\v 53 And ye shall dispossesse the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I haue giuen you the land to possesse it.
\p
\v 54 And ye shall diuide the land by lot, for an inheritance among your families, and to the moe ye shall giue the more inheritance, and to the fewer yee shall giue the lesse inheritance: euery mans inheritance shall bee in the place where his lot falleth, according to the tribes of your fathers, ye shall inherite.
\p
\v 55 But if ye will not driue out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it shall come to passe that those which ye let remaine of them, shall be prickes in your eyes, and thornes in your sides, and shal vexe you in the land wherein ye dwell.
\p
\v 56 Moreouer, it shall come to passe, that I shall do vnto you, as I thought to doe vnto them.

\c 34
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan, (this is the land that shall fall vnto you for an inheritance, euen the land of Canaan, with the coasts thereof.)
\p
\v 3 Then your South quarter shall be from the wildernesse of Zin, along by the coast of Edom, and your South border shall be the outmost coast of the salt Sea Eastward.
\p
\v 4 And your border shal turne from the South to the ascent of Akrabbim, and passe on to Zin: and the going foorth thereof shall be from the South to Kadesh-Barnea, and shall goe on to Hazar-Addar, and passe on to Azmon.
\p
\v 5 And the border shall fetch a comcompasse from Azmon vnto the riuer of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.
\p
\v 6 And as for the Westerne border, you shall euen haue the great sea for a border: this shall be your West border.
\p
\v 7 And this shall be your North border: from the great sea, you shall point out for you, mount Hor.
\p
\v 8 From mount Hor, ye shall point out your border vnto the entrance of Hamath: and the goings foorth of the border shall be to Zedad.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And the border shall goe on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall bee at Hazar Enan: this shall be your North border.
\p
\v 10 And ye shall point out your East border, from Hazar Enan to Shepham.
\p
\v 11 And the coast shall goe downe from Shepham to Riblah, on the East side of Ain: and the border shall descend and shall reach vnto the side of the sea of Chinnereth Eastward.
\p
\v 12 And the border shall goe downe to Iordane, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coastes thereof round about.
\p
\v 13 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherite by lot, which the Lord commanded to giue vnto the nine tribes, and to the halfe tribe.
\p
\v 14 For the tribe of the children of Reuben, according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad, according to the house of their fathers, haue receiued their inheritance, and halfe the tribe of Manasseh haue receiued their inheritance.
\p
\v 15 The two tribes, and the halfe tribe haue receiued their inheritance on this side Iordane neere Iericho, Eastward, toward the Sunne rising.
\p
\v 16 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 17 These are the names of the men which shall diuide the land vnto you: Eleazar the Priest, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun.
\p
\v 18 And yee shall take one Prince of euery tribe, to diuide the land by inheritance.
\p

\c 35
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses in the plaines of Moab by Iordane, neere Iericho, saying,
\p
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, that they giue vnto the Leuites of the inheritance of their possession, cities to dwell in: and yee shall giue also vnto the Leuites suburbs for the cities round about them.
\p
\v 3 And the cities shall they haue to dwell in, and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattell, and for their goods, and for all their beasts.
\p
\v 4 And the suburbs of the cities, which yee shall giue vnto the Leuites, shall reach from the wall of the citie, and outward, a thousand cubites round about.
\p
\v 5 And ye shall measure from without the city on the Eastside two thousand cubites, and on the Southside two thousand cubites, and on the Westside two thousand cubites, & on the Northside two thousand cubites: and the citie shall be in the midst; this shalbe to them the suburbs of the cities.
\p
\v 6 And among the cities which yee shal giue vnto the Leuites, there shalbe sixe cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that hee may flee thither: And to them ye shall adde fourty and two cities.
\p
\v 7 So all the cities which ye shall giue to the Leuites, shall be fourty and eight cities: them shall yee giue with their suburbs.
\p
\v 8 And the cities which ye shal giue, shalbe of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that haue many ye shall giue many; but from them that haue few, ye shall giue few. Euery one shal giue of his cities vnto the Leuites, according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 10 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye bee come ouer Iordane, into the land of Canaan:
\p
\v 11 Then ye shall appoint you cities, to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither which killeth any person at vnawares.
\p
\v 12 And they shall be vnto you cities for refuge from the auenger, that the man-slayer die not, vntill he stand before the Congregation in iudgement.
\p
\v 13 And of these cities which ye shall giue, sixe cities shall ye haue for refuge.
\p
\v 14 Yee shall giue three cities on this side Iordane, and three cities shall yee giue in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.
\p
\v 15 These sixe cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the soiourner among them: that euery one that killeth any person vnawares, may flee thither.
\p
\v 16 And if he smite him with an instrument of Iron, (so that he die,) hee is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 17 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, (wherewith hee may die) and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 18 Or if he smite him with an handweapon of wood, (wherewith he may die) and he die, hee is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 19 The reuenger of blood himselfe shall slay the murtherer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.
\p
\v 20 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurle at him by laying of waite that he die,
\p
\v 21 Or in enmitie smite him with his hand, that he die: hee that smote him shall surely be put to death, for hee is a murderer: the reuenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when hee meeteth him.
\p
\v 22 But if hee thrust him suddenly without enmitie, or haue cast vpon him any thing without laying of wait,
\p
\v 23 Or with any stone wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it vpon him, that he die, and was not his enemie, neither sought his harme:
\p
\v 24 Then the Congregation shall iudge betweene the slayer, and the reuenger of blood, according to these iudgements.
\p
\v 25 And the Congregation shall deliuer the slayer out of the hand of the reuenger of blood, and the Congregation shal restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it vnto the death of the high Priest, which was annoynted with the holy oyle.
\p
\v 26 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the citie of his refuge, whither he was fled:
\p
\v 27 And the reuenger of blood finde him without the borders of the citie of his refuge, and the reuenger of blood kill the slayer, he shall not be guiltie of blood:
\p
\v 28 Because he should haue remained in the citie of his refuge, vntill the death of the high Priest: but after the death of the hie Priest, the slayer shal returne into the land of his possession.
\p
\v 29 So these things shall be for a statute of iudgment vnto you, thorowout your generations in al your dwellings.
\p
\v 30 Who so killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death, by the mouth of witnesses: but one witnesse shall not testifie against any person, to cause him to die.
\p
\v 31 Moreouer, yee shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guiltie of death, but he shalbe surely put to death.
\p
\v 32 And yee shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the citie of his refuge, that hee should come againe to dwell in the land, vntil the death of the Priest.
\p
\v 33 So ye shall not pollute the lande wherein ye are: for blood, it defileth the land: and the land cannot bee cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.
\p
\v 34 Defile not therefore the lande which yee shall inhabite, wherein I dwell: for I the Lord dwell among the children of Israel.

\p
\v 1 And the chiefe fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the sonne of Machir, the sonne of Manasseh, of the families of the sonnes of Ioseph, came neere, and spake before Moses, and before the Princes the chiefe fathers of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 2 And they said, The Lord commanded my lord to giue the lande for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the Lord, to giue the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother, vnto his daughters.
\p
\v 3 And if they bee married to any of the sonnes of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall bee put to the inheritance of the tribe, whereinto they are receiued: so shal it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
\p
\v 4 And when the Iubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put vnto the inheritance of the tribe, whereunto they are receiued: So shal their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
\p
\v 5 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, according to the worde of the Lord, saying, The tribe of the sonnes of Ioseph hath said well.
\p
\v 6 This is the thing which the Lord doeth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they thinke best: onely to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.
\p
\v 7 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remooue from tribe to tribe: for euery one of the children of Israel shall keepe himselfe to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
\p
\v 8 And euery daughter that possesseth an inheritance, in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife vnto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enioy euery man the inheritance of his fathers.
\p
\v 9 Neither shall the inheritance remoue from one tribe to another tribe: but euery one of the tribes of the children of Israel, shall keepe himselfe to his owne inheritance.
\p
\v 10 Euen as the Lord commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad.
\p
\v 11 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah the daughters of Zelophehad, were married vnto their fathers brothers sonnes.
\p
\v 12 And they were married into the families of the sonnes of Manasseh, the sonne of Ioseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
\p
\v 13 These are the commandements and the iudgements which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses, vnto the children of Israel in the plaines of Moab, by Iordane, neere Iericho.
