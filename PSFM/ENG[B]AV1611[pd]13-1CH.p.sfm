\v 39 And Ner begat Kish, and Kish begate Saul, and Saul begate Ionathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.
\p
\v 40 And the sonne of Ionathan was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begate Micah.
\p
\v 41 And the sonnes of Micah were Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, and Ahaz.
\p
\v 42 And Ahaz begate Iarah, and Iarah begate Alemeth, & Azmaueth, and Zimri: and Zimri begate Moza,
\p
\v 43 And Moza begate Binea: and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his sonne, Azel his sonne.
\p
\v 44 And Azel had sixe sonnes, whose names are these: Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ismael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan. These were the sonnes of Azel.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 Nowe the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell downe slaine in mount Gilboa.
\p
\v 2 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sonnes, and the Philistines slew Ionathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sonnes of Saul.
\p
\v 3 And the battell went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.
\p
\v 4 Then saide Saul to his armour bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith, lest these vncircumcised come, and abuse mee: but his armour bearer would not, for he was sore afraid. So Saul tooke a sword, and fell vpon it.
\p
\v 5 And when his armour bearer saw that Saul was dead, hee fell likewise on the sword, and died.
\p
\v 6 So Saul died, and his three sonnes, and all his house died together.
\p
\v 7 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley, saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sonnes were dead: then they forsooke their cities, and fled, and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And it came to passe on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slaine, that they found Saul and his sonnes fallen in mount Gilboa.
\p
\v 9 And when they had stripped him, they tooke his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to cary tidings vnto their idoles, and to the people.
\p
\v 10 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And when all Iabesh Gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul:
\p
\v 12 They arose, all the valiant men, and tooke away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sonnes, and brought them to Iabesh, and buried their bones vnder the oke in Iabesh, and fasted seuen dayes.
\p
\v 13 ¶ So Saul died for his transgression which hee committed against the Lord, euen against the word of the Lord which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it:
\p
\v 14 And enquired not of the Lord: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdome vnto Dauid the sonne of Iesse.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 Then all Israel gathered themselues to Dauid vnHebron, saying, Behold, wee are thy bone and thy flesh.
\p
\v 2 And moreouer in time past, euen when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the Lord thy God said vnto thee, Thou shalt feede my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler ouer my people Israel.
\p
\v 3 Therefore came all the Elders of Israel to the king to Hebron, and Dauid made a couenant with them in Hebron before the Lord, and they annointed Dauid king ouer Israel, according to the word of the Lord, by Samuel.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And Dauid & all Israel, went to Ierusalem, which is Iebus, where the Iebusites were the inhabitants of the land.
\p
\v 5 And the inhabitants of Iebus said to Dauid, Thou shalt not come hither. Neuerthelesse Dauid tooke the castle of Zion, which is the citie of Dauid.
\p
\v 6 And Dauid said, Whosoeuer smiteth the Iebusites first, shall be chiefe, and captaine. So Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah went first vp, and was chiefe.
\p
\v 7 And Dauid dwelt in the castell: therefore they called it the citie of Dauid.
\p
\v 8 And he built the citie round about, euen from Millo round about: and Ioab repaired the rest of the citie.
\p
\v 9 So Dauid waxed greater and greater: for the Lord of hostes was with him.
\p
\v 10 ¶ These also are the chiefe of the mightie men, whom Dauid had, who strenthened themselues with him in his kingdome, and with all Israel, to make him king according to the word of the Lord, concerning Israel.
\p
\v 11 And this is the number of the mightie men, whom Dauid had: Iashobeam an Hachmonite, the chiefe of the captaines: he lift vp his speare against three hundred, slaine by him at one time.
\p
\v 12 And after him was Eleazar the sonne of Dodo the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.
\p
\v 13 He was with Dauid at Pasdammim; and there the Philistines were gathered together to battell, where was a parcell of ground full of barley, and the people fled from before the Philistines.
\p
\v 14 And they set themselues in the middest of that parcell, and deliuered it, and slue the Philistines, & the Lord saued them by a great deliuerance.
\p
\v 15 ¶ Now three of the thirtie captaines, went downe to the rocke of Dauid, into the caue of Adullam, and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.
\p
\v 16 And Dauid was then in the hold, and the Philistines garison was then at Bethlehem.
\p
\v 17 And Dauid longed and said, Oh that one would giue me drinke of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate.
\p
\v 18 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and tooke it and brought it to Dauid. But Dauid would not drink of it, but powred it out to the Lord,
\p
\v 19 And said, My God forbid it mee, that I should doe this thing. Shall I drinke the blood of these men, that haue put their liues in ieopardie? for with the ieopardie of their liues, they brought it: therfore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And Abishai the brother of Ioab, he was chiefe of the three. For lifting vp his speare against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.
\p
\v 21 Of the three, hee was more honourable then the two, for he was their captaine; howbeit, he attained not to the first three.
\p
\v 22 Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, the sonne of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts: he slue two Lyon-like men of Moab, also he went downe and slue a Lyon in a pit in a snowy day.
\p
\v 23 And he slue an Egyptian, a man of great stature, fiue cubits high, and in the Egyptians hand was a speare like a weauers beame: and he went downe to him with a staffe, and pluckt the speare out of the Egyptians hand, and slue him with his owne speare.
\p
\v 24 These things did Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.
\p
\v 25 Behold, hee was honourable among the thirtie, but attained not to the first three: and Dauid set him ouer his guard.
\p
\v 26 ¶ Also the valiant men of the armies were Asahel the brother of Ioab, Elhanan the sonne of Dodo of Bethlehem.
\p
\v 27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
\p
\v 28 Ira the sonne of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,
\p
\v 29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,

\v 30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the sonne of Baanah the Netophathite,
\p
\v 31 Ithai the sonne of Ribai of Gibeah, that perteined to the children of Beniamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
\p
\v 32 Hurai of the brookes of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,

\v 34 The sonnes of Hashem the Gizonite: Ionathan the sonne of Shageh the Hararite,
\p
\v 35 Ahiham the sonne of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the sonne of Ur,
\p
\v 36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahiiah the Pelonite,
\p
\v 37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the sonne of Ezbai,
\p
\v 38 Ioel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the sonne of Haggeri,
\p
\v 39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armour bearer of Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah,
\p
\v 40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
\p
\v 41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the sonne of Ahlai,
\p
\v 42 Adina the sonne of Shiza the Reubenite, a captaine of the Reubenites, and thirtie with him,
\p
\v 43 Hanan the sonne of Maacah, and Ioshaphat the Mithnite,
\p
\v 44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Iehiel the sonnes of Hothan the Aroerite,
\p
\v 45 Iediael the sonne of Zimri, and Ioha his brother, the Tizite,
\p
\v 46 Eliel the Mahauite, and Ieribai, and Ioshauiah the sonnes of Elnaan, and Ithmah the Moabite,
\p
\v 47 Eliel, and Obed, and Iasiel the Mesobaite.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Now these are they that came to Dauid to Ziklag while hee yet kept himselfe close, because of Saul the sonne of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the warre.
\p
\v 2 They were armed with bowes, and could vse both the right hand and the left, in hurling stones, and shooting arrowes out of a bow, euen of Sauls brethren of Beniamin.
\p
\v 3 The chiefe was Ahiezer, then Ioash the sonnes of Shemaah the Gibeathite, and Ieziel, and Pelet, the sonnes of Azmaueth, and Berachah, and Iehu the Antothite,
\p
\v 4 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mightie man among the thirtie, and ouer the thirtie, and Ieremiah, and Iahaziel, and Iohanan, and Iosabad the Gederathite,
\p
\v 5 Eleuzai, and Ierimoth, and Bealiath, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite,
\p
\v 6 Elkanah, and Iesiah, and Azariel, and Ioezer, and Iashobeam, the Korhites,
\p
\v 7 And Ioelah, and Zebadiah the sonnes of Ieroam of Gedor.
\p
\v 8 And of the Gadites there separated themselues vnto Dauid, into the hold to the wildernesse, men of might, and men of warre, fit for the battel, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of Lyons, and were as swift as the Roes vpon the mountaines:
\p
\v 9 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,
\p
\v 10 Mashmannah the fourth, Ieremiah the fift,
\p
\v 11 Atthai the sixt, Eliel the seuenth,
\p
\v 12 Iohanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
\p
\v 13 Ieremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleuenth.
\p
\v 14 These were of the sonnes of Gad, captaines of the hoste: one of the least was ouer an hundred, and the greatest, ouer a thousand.
\p
\v 15 These are they that went ouer Iorden in the first moneth, when it had ouerflowen all his bankes, and they put to flight all them of the valleis, both toward the East, and toward the West.
\p
\v 16 And there came of the children of Beniamin, and Iudah, to the hold vnto Dauid.
\p
\v 17 And Dauid went out to meete them, and answered and sayd vnto them: If yee bee come peaceably vnto me to helpe me, mine heart shall be knit vnto you: but if yee be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands: the God of our fathers looke thereon, and rebuke it.
\p
\v 18 Then the spirit came vpon Amasai, who was chiefe of the captaines, and he sayd, Thine are we, Dauid, and on thy side, thou sonne of Iesse: Peace, peace be vnto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then Dauid receiued them, and made them captaines of the band.
\p
\v 19 And there fell some of Manasseh to Dauid, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battell, but they helped them not. For the Lords of the Philistines, vpon aduisement, sent him away, saying, Hee will fall to his master Saul, to the ieopardie of our heads.
\p
\v 20 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Iozabad, and Iediel, and Michael, and Iozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captaines of the thousands that were of Manasseh.
\p
\v 21 And they helped Dauid against the band of the Rouers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captaines in the hoste.
\p
\v 22 For at that time day by day, there came to Dauid to helpe him, vntill it was a great hoste, like the hoste of God.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And these are the numbers of the bands, that were ready armed to the warre, and came to Dauid to Hebron, to turne the kingdome of Saul to him, according to the word of the Lord.
\p
\v 24 The children of Iudah that bare shield, and speare, were sixe thousand, and eight hundred, readie armed to the warre.
\p
\v 25 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the warre, seuen thousand and one hundred.
\p
\v 26 Of the children of Leui, foure thousand and sixe hundred.
\p
\v 27 And Iehoiada was the leader of the Aaronits, and with him were three thousand, and seuen hundred.
\p
\v 28 And Zadok a young man mightie of valour, and of his fathers house twentie and two captaines.
\p
\v 29 And of the children of Beniamin the kinred of Saul three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.
\p
\v 30 And of the children of Ephraim, twentie thousand, and eight hundred, mightie men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.
\p
\v 31 And of the halfe tribe of Manasseh, eighteene thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make Dauid king.
\p
\v 32 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had vnderstanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to doe: the heads of them were two hundred, and all their brethren were at their commandement.
\p
\v 33 Of Zebulun, such as went foorth to battell, expert in warre, with all instruments of warre, fifty thousand, which could keepe ranke: They were not of double heart.
\p
\v 34 And of Naphtali a thousand captaines, and with them, with shield and speare, thirtie and seuen thousand.
\p
\v 35 And of the Danites, expert in war, twentie and eight thousand, and sixe hundred.
\p
\v 36 And of Asher, such as went foorth to battell, expert in warre, fourtie thousand.
\p
\v 37 And on the other side of Iorden, of the Reubenites, & the Gadites, and of the halfe tribe of Manasseh, with all maner of instruments of warre for the battell, an hundred and twentie thousand.
\p
\v 38 All these men of warre, that could keepe ranke, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make Dauid king ouer all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel, were of one heart to make Dauid king.
\p
\v 39 And there they were with Dauid three dayes, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.
\p
\v 40 Moreouer, they that were nigh them, euen vnto Issachar, and Zebulun, and Naphtali brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meale, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oyle, and oxen, and sheepe abundantly: for there was ioy in Israel.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 And Dauid consulted with the captaines of thousands, and hundreds, and with euery leader.
\p
\v 2 And Dauid said vnto all the Congregation of Israel, If it seeme good vnto you, and that it be of the Lord our God, let vs send abroad vnto our brethren euery where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the Priests and Leuites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselues vnto vs.
\p
\v 3 And let vs bring againe the Arke of our God to vs: for wee enquired not at it in the dayes of Saul.
\p
\v 4 And all the Congregation saide, that they would doe so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
\p
\v 5 So Dauid gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt, euen vnto the entring of Hemath, to bring the Arke of God from Kiriath-iearim.
\p
\v 6 And Dauid went vp, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-iearim, which belonged to Iudah, to bring vp thence the Arke of God the Lord, that dwelleth betweene the Cherubims, whose name is called on it.
\p
\v 7 And they caried the Arke of God in a new cart, out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza, and Ahio draue the cart.
\p
\v 8 And Dauid and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harpes, and with psalteries, and with tymbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And when they came vnto the threshing floore of Chidon, Uzza put foorth his hand to hold the Arke, for the oxen stumbled.
\p
\v 10 And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzza, and hee smote him, because hee put his hand to the Arke: and there he died before God.
\p
\v 11 And Dauid was displeased, because the Lord had made a breach vpon Uzza; wherefore that place is called Perez-Uzza, to this day.
\p
\v 12 And Dauid was afraide of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the Arke of God home to me?
\p
\v 13 So Dauid brought not the Arke home to himselfe to the city of Dauid, but caried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
\p
\v 14 And the Arke of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three moneths. And the Lord blessed the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he had.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to Dauid, and timber of Cedars, with masons, and carpenters to build him an house.
\p
\v 2 And Dauid perceiued that the Lord had confirmed him king ouer Israel, for his kingdome was lift vp on high, because of his people Israel.
\p
\v 3 ¶ And Dauid tooke moe wiues at Ierusalem: and Dauid begate moe sonnes and daughters.
\p
\v 4 Now these are the names of his children which hee had in Ierusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,
\p
\v 5 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,
\p
\v 6 And Noga, and Nepheg, and Iaphia,
\p
\v 7 And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Elpalet.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And when the Philistines heard that Dauid was anoynted king ouer all Israel, all the Philistines went vp to seeke Dauid: and Dauid heard of it, and went out against them.
\p
\v 9 And the Philistines came & spread themselues in the valley of Rephaim.
\p
\v 10 And Dauid enquired of God, saying, Shall I goe vp against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliuer them into mine hand? And the Lord said vnto him, Go vp, for I will deliuer them into thine hand.
\p
\v 11 So they came vp to Baal-Perazim, and Dauid smote them there. Then Dauid said, God hath broken in vpon mine enemies by mine hand, like the breaking foorth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place, Baal-Perazim.
\p
\v 12 And when they had left their gods there, Dauid gaue a commandement, and they were burnt with fire.
\p
\v 13 And the Philistines yet againe spread themselues abroad in the valley.
\p
\v 14 Therfore Dauid enquired againe of God, and God said vnto him, Goe not vp after them, turne away from them, and come vpon them ouer against the mulbery trees.
\p
\v 15 And it shall bee, when thou shalt heare a sound of going in the tops of the mulbery trees, that then thou shalt goe out to battaile: for God is gone foorth before thee, to smite the hoste of the Philistines.
\p
\v 16 Dauid therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the hoste of the Philistines from Gibeon euen to Gazer.
\p
\v 17 And the fame of Dauid went out into all lands, and the Lord brought the feare of him vpon all nations.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 And Dauid made him houses in the citie of Dauid, and prepared a place for the Arke of God, and pitched for it a tent.
\p
\v 2 Then Dauid sayd, None ought to carie the Arke of God, but the Leuites: for them hath the Lord chosen to cary the Arke of God, and to minister vnto him for euer.
\p
\v 3 And Dauid gathered all Israel together to Ierusalem, to bring vp the Arke of the Lord vnto his place, which hee had prepared for it.
\p
\v 4 And Dauid assembled the children of Aaron, and the Leuites.
\p
\v 5 Of the sonnes of Kohath: Uriel the chiefe, and his brethren an hundred and twentie.
\p
\v 6 Of the sonnes of Merari: Asaiah the chiefe, and his brethren two hundred and twentie.
\p
\v 7 Of the sonnes of Gershom: Ioel the chiefe, and his brethren an hundred and thirtie.
\p
\v 8 Of the sonnes of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the chiefe, and his brethren two hundred.
\p
\v 9 Of the sonnes of Hebron: Eliel the chiefe, and his brethren fourescore.
\p
\v 10 Of the sonnes of Uzziel: Amminadab the chiefe, and his brethren an hundred and twelue.
\p
\v 11 And Dauid called for Zadok and Abiathar the Priests, and for the Leuites, for Uriel, Asaiah and Ioel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
\p
\v 12 And said vnto them, Yee are the chiefe of the fathers of the Leuites: sanctifie your selues both yee and your brethren, that you may bring vp the Arke of the Lord God of Israel, vnto the place that I haue prepared for it.
\p
\v 13 For because ye did it not at the first, the Lord our God made a breach vpon vs, for that we sought him not after the due order.
\p
\v 14 So the Priestes and the Leuites sanctified themselues to bring vp the Arke of the Lord God of Israel.
\p
\v 15 And the children of the Leuites bare the Arke of God vpon their shoulders, with the staues thereon, as Moses commanded, according to the word of the Lord.
\p
\v 16 And Dauid spake to the chiefe of the Leuites, to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musicke, Psalteries, and Harpes, and Cymbales, sounding, by lifting vp the voice with ioy.
\p
\v 17 So the Leuites appointed Heman the sonne of Ioel: and of his brethren. Asaph the sonne of Berechiah: and of the sonnes of Merari their brethren, Ethan the sonne of Kushaiah.
\p
\v 18 And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zachariah, Ben, and Iaziel, & Shemiramoth, and Iehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maasiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphaleh, and Mikniah, and Obed Edom, and Iehiel the Porters.
\p
\v 19 So the Singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbales of brasse.
\p
\v 20 And Zachariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Iehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maasiah, and Benaiah, with Psalteries on Alamoth.
\p
\v 21 And Mattithiah, and Eliphaleh, and Mikniah, and Obed Edom, and Ieiel, and Azzaziah, with harpes on the Sheminith to excell.
\p
\v 22 And Chenaniah chiefe of the Leuites was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilfull.
\p
\v 23 And Berechiah, and Elkanah were doore keepers for the Arke.
\p
\v 24 And Shebaniah, and Iehoshaphat, and Nathaneel, and Amasai, and Zachariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the Arke of God: and Obed Edom, and Iehiah were doore keepers for the Arke.
\p
\v 25 ¶ So Dauid and the Elders of Israel, and the captaines ouer thousands, went to bring vp the Arke of the couenant of the Lord, out of the house of Obed Edom with ioy.
\p
\v 26 And it came to passe when God helped the Leuites that bare the Arke of the couenant of the Lord, that they offered seuen bullocks, and seuen rammes.
\p
\v 27 And Dauid was clothed with a robe of fine linnen, and all the Leuites that bare the Arke, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song, with the singers. Dauid also had vpon him, an Ephod of linnen.
\p
\v 28 Thus all Israel brought vp the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harpes.
\p
\v 29 ¶ And it came to passe as the Arke of the couenant of the Lord came to the citie of Dauid, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window, saw King Dauid dauncing and playing: and shee despised him in her heart.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 So they brought the Arke of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that Dauid had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices, and peace offerings before God.
\p
\v 2 And when Dauid had made an end of offering the burnt offerings, and the peace offrings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord.
\p
\v 3 And hee dealt to euery one of Israel, both man and woman, to euery one a loafe of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And he appointed certaine of the Leuites to minister before the Arke of the Lord, and to record, and to thanke and praise the Lord God of Israel,
\p
\v 5 Asaph the chiefe, and next to him Zachariah, Ieiel, and Shemiramoth, and Iehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed Edom: and Ieiel with Psalteries and with harpes: but Asaph made a sound with cymbals.
\p
\v 6 Benaiah also and Iahaziel the Priestes, with trumpets continually before the Arke of the Couenant of God.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Then on that day, Dauid deliuered first this Psalme to thanke the Lord, into the hand of Asaph and his brethren:
\p
\v 8 Giue thankes vnto the Lord, call vpon his name, make knowen his deeds among the people.
\p
\v 9 Sing vnto him, sing psalmes vnto him, talke you of all his wonderous workes.
\p
\v 10 Glory yee in his holy Name, let the heart of them reioyce that seeke the Lord.
\p
\v 11 Seeke the Lord, and his strength, seeke his face continually.
\p
\v 12 Remember his marueilous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the iudgements of his mouth,
\p
\v 13 O ye seed of Israel his seruant, ye children of Iacob his chosen ones.
\p
\v 14 He is the Lord our God, his iudgements are in all the earth.
\p
\v 15 Be ye mindfull alwayes of his Couenant: the worde which hee commanded to a thousand generations:
\p
\v 16 Euen of the Couenant which hee made with Abraham, and of his othe vnto Isaac:
\p
\v 17 And hath confirmed the same to Iacob for a lawe, and to Israel for an euerlasting Couenant,
\p
\v 18 Saying, vnto thee will I giue the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance.
\p
\v 19 When ye were but few, euen a few, and strangers in it:
\p
\v 20 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdome to another people:
\p
\v 21 Hee suffered no man to doe them wrong: yea, hee reprooued kings for their sakes,
\p
\v 22 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and doe my Prophets no harme.
\p
\v 23 Sing vnto the Lord all the earth: shew foorth from day to day his saluation.
\p
\v 24 Declare his glory among the heathen: his marueilous workes among all nations.
\p
\v 25 For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared aboue all gods.
\p
\v 26 For all the gods of the people are idoles: but the Lord made the heauens.
\p
\v 27 Glory and honour are in his presence: strength and gladnesse are in his place.
\p
\v 28 Giue vnto the Lord, yee kinreds of the people: giue vnto the Lord glory and strength.
\p
\v 29 Giue vnto the Lord the glory due vnto his Name: bring an offering, and come before him, worship the Lord in the beautie of holinesse.
\p
\v 30 Feare before him all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not mooued.
\p
\v 31 Let the heauens be glad, and let the earth reioyce: and let men say among the nations, The Lord reigneth.
\p
\v 32 Let the sea roare, and the fulnesse thereof: let the fieldes reioyce, and all that is therein.
\p
\v 33 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the Lord, because hee commeth to iudge the earth.
\p
\v 34 O giue thanks vnto the Lord, for hee is good: for his mercy endureth for euer.
\p
\v 35 And say yee, Saue vs, O God of our saluation, and gather vs together, and deliuer vs from the heathen, that we may giue thanks to thy holy Name, and glory in thy praise.
\p
\v 36 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for euer and euer: and all the people saide, Amen, and praised the Lord.
\p
\v 37 ¶ So hee left there before the Arke of the couenant of the Lord, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the Arke continually, as euery dayes worke required:
\p
\v 38 And Obed Edom with their brethren, threescore and eight: Obed Edom also the sonne of Ieduthun, and Hosah to be porters:
\p
\v 39 And Zadok the Priest, and his brethren the Priests, before the Tabernacle of the Lord, in the high place that was at Gibeon,
\p
\v 40 To offer burnt offerings vnto the Lord, vpon the Altar of the burnt offering continually morning and euening, and to doe according to all that is written in the Lawe of the Lord, which hee commanded Israel:
\p
\v 41 And with them Heman and Ieduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to giue thankes to the Lord, because his mercy endureth for euer.
\p
\v 42 And with them Heman and Ieduthun with trumpets and cymbales, for those that should make a sound, and with musicall instruments of God: and the sonnes of Ieduthun were Porters.
\p
\v 43 And all the people departed euery man to his house, and Dauid returned to blesse his house.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 Now it came to passe, as Dauid sate in his house, that Dauid sayde to Nathan the Prophet, Loe, I dwell in an house of Cedars, but the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord remaineth vnder curtaines.
\p
\v 2 Then Nathan sayd vnto Dauid, Doe all that is in thine heart, for God is with thee.
\p
\v 3 ¶ And it came to passe the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
\p
\v 4 Goe and tell Dauid my seruant, Thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in.
\p
\v 5 For I haue not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought vp Israel, vnto this day, but haue gone from tent to tent, and from one Tabernacle to another.
\p
\v 6 Wheresoeuer I haue walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the Iudges of Israel (whom I commanded to feed my people) saying, Why haue ye not built me an house of Cedars?
\p
\v 7 Now therefore thus shalt thou say vnto my seruant Dauid, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I tooke thee from the Sheep-coat, euen from folowing the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler ouer my people Israel:
\p
\v 8 And I haue bene with thee whithersoeuer thou hast walked, and haue cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and haue made thee a name, like the name of the great men that are in the earth.
\p
\v 9 Also I will ordeine a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moued no more: neither shal the children of wickednesse waste them any more (as at the beginning,
\p
\v 10 And since the time that I commanded Iudges to bee ouer my people Israel.) Moreouer, I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tel thee, that the Lord will build thee an house.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And it shall come to passe, when thy dayes be expired, that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise vp thy seed after thee, which shall bee of thy sonnes, and I wil stablish his kingdome.
\p
\v 12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for euer.
\p
\v 13 I will be his father, and he shall be my sonne, and I will not take my mercie away from him, as I tooke it from him that was before thee.
\p
\v 14 But I will settle him in mine house, and in my kingdom for euer, and his throne shall bee established for euermore.
\p
\v 15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speake vnto Dauid.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And Dauid the king came, and sate before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought mee hitherto?
\p
\v 17 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God: for thou hast also spoken of thy seruants house, for a great while to come, and hast regarded mee according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Lord God.
\p
\v 18 What can Dauid speake more to thee for the honour of thy seruant? for thou knowest thy seruant.
\p
\v 19 O Lord, for thy seruants sake, and according to thine owne heart, hast thou done all this greatnesse in making knowen all these great things.
\p
\v 20 O Lord, there is none like thee neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we haue heard with our eares.
\p
\v 21 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whome God went to redeeme to be his owne people, to make thee a name of greatnesse and terriblenesse, by driuing out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?
\p
\v 22 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine owne people for euer, and thou, Lord, becamest their God.
\p
\v 23 Therefore now Lord, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy seruant, and concerning his house, be established for euer, and doe as thou hast said.
\p
\v 24 Let it euen bee established, that thy name may bee magnified for euer, saying, The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel, euen a God to Israel: and let the house of Dauid thy seruant be established before thee.
\p
\v 25 For thou, O my God, hast tolde thy seruant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy seruant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.
\p
\v 26 And now, Lord (thou art God, and hast promised this goodnesse vnto thy seruant.)
\p
\v 27 Now therefore let it please thee to blesse the house of thy seruant, that it may bee before thee for euer: for thou blessest, O Lord, and it shalbe blessed for euer.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 Now after this, it came to passe, that Dauid smote the Philistines & subdued them, and tooke Gath, and her townes out of the hand of the Philistines.
\p
\v 2 And he smote Moab, and the Moabites became Dauids seruants, and brought gifts.
\p
\v 3 ¶ And Dauid smote Hadarezer king of Zobah vnto Hamath, as hee went to stablish his dominion by the riuer Euphrates.
\p
\v 4 And Dauid tooke from him a thousand charets, and seuen thousand horsemen, and twentie thousand footmen: Dauid also houghed all the charet horses, but reserued of them an hundred charets.
\p
\v 5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to helpe Hadarezer king of Zobah, Dauid slew of the Syrians two and twentie thousand men.
\p
\v 6 Then Dauid put garisons in Syria Damascus, and the Syrians became Dauids seruants, and brought giftes. Thus the Lord preserued Dauid, whithersoeuer he went.
\p
\v 7 And Dauid tooke the shields of golde that were on the seruants of Hadarezer, & brought them to Ierusalem.
\p
\v 8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, broght Dauid very much brasse, wherewith Solomon made the brasen Sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brasse.
\p
\v 9 ¶ Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how Dauid had smitten all the hoste of Hadarezer king of Zobah:
\p
\v 10 Hee sent Hadoram his sonne to king Dauid, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because hee had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him (for Hadarezer had warre with Tou) and with him all manner of vessels of golde and siluer, and brasse.
\p
\v 11 ¶ Them also king Dauid dedicated vnto the Lord, with the siluer and the golde that he brought from all these nations: from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
\p
\v 12 Moreouer, Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah, slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt, eighteene thousand.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And he put garisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became Dauids seruants. Thus the Lord preserued Dauid whithersoeuer he went.
\p
\v 14 ¶ So Dauid reigned ouer all Israel, and executed iudgement and iustice among all his people.
\p
\v 15 And Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah was ouer the hoste, and Iehoshaphat the sonne of Ahilud, Recorder.
\p
\v 16 And Zadok the sonne of Ahitub, and Abimelech the sonne of Abiathar, were the Priests, and Shausha was Scribe.
\p
\v 17 And Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada was ouer the Cherethites, and the Pelethites: and the sonnes of Dauid were chiefe about the king.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 Now it came to passe after this, that Nahash the King of the children of Ammon dyed, & his sonne reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 2 And Dauid sayde, I will shewe kindnesse vnto Hanun the sonne of Nahash, because his father shewed kindnesse to mee. And Dauid sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the seruants of Dauid came into the land of the children of Ammon, to Hanun, to comfort him.
\p
\v 3 But the Princes of the children of Ammon sayde to Hanun, Thinkest thou that Dauid doeth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters vnto thee? Are not his seruants come vnto thee for to search, and to ouerthrow, and to spie out the land?
\p
\v 4 Wherefore Hanun tooke Dauids seruants, and shaued them, and cut off their garments in the middest, hard by their buttockes, and sent them away.
\p
\v 5 Then there went certeine, and told Dauid, how the men were serued, and hee sent to meet them (for the men were greatly ashamed) and the King sayde, Tary at Iericho vntill your beards be growen, and then returne.
\p
\v 6 ¶ And when the children of Ammon sawe, that they had made themselues odious to Dauid; Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of siluer, to hire them charets and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-Maachah, and out of Zobah.
\p
\v 7 So they hired thirtie and two thousand charets, and the king of Maachah and his people, who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselues together from their cities, and came to battaile.
\p
\v 8 And when Dauid heard of it, hee sent Ioab, and all the host of the mightie men.
\p
\v 9 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battell in aray before the gate of the citie, and the kings that were come, were by themselues in the field.
\p
\v 10 Now when Ioab saw that the battell was set against him, before and behinde: hee chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in aray against the Syrians.
\p
\v 11 And the rest of the people hee deliuered vnto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselues in aray against the children of Ammon.
\p
\v 12 And he said, If the Syrians bee too strong for me, then thou shalt helpe me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I wil helpe thee.
\p
\v 13 Be of good courage, and let vs behaue our selues valiantly for our people, and for the Cities of our God: and let the Lord do that which is good in his sight.
\p
\v 14 So Ioab and the people that were with him, drew nigh before the Syrians, vnto the battell; and they fled before him.
\p
\v 15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entred into the city. Then Ioab came to Ierusalem.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians, that were beyond the Riuer: and Shophach the captaine of the hoste of Hadarezer, went before them.
\p
\v 17 And it was tolde Dauid, and hee gathered all Israel, and passed ouer Iordane, and came vpon them, and set the battell in aray against them: so when Dauid had put the battell in aray against the Syrians, they fought with him.
\p
\v 18 But the Syrians fled before Israel, and Dauid slew of the Syrians seuen thousand men, which fought in charets, and fourty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captaine of the hoste.
\p
\v 19 And when the seruants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Dauid, and became his seruants: neither would the Syrians helpe the children of Ammon any more.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe, that after the yeere was expired, at the time that kings goe out to battell, Ioab led forth the power of the armie, and wasted the countrey of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah (but Dauid taried at Ierusalem,) and Ioab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.
\p
\v 2 And Dauid tooke the crowne of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it, and it was set vpon Dauids head; and hee brought also exceeding much spoile out of the city.
\p
\v 3 And hee brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with sawes, and with harrowes of yron, and with axes: euen so dealt Dauid with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And Dauid and all the people returned to Ierusalem.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And it came to passe after this, that there arose warre at Gezer with the Philistines, at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite, slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.
\p
\v 5 And there was warre againe with the Philistines, and Elhanan the sonne of Iair, slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spearestaffe was like a weauers beame.
\p
\v 6 And yet againe there was warre at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were foure and twentie, sixe on each hand, and sixe on each foot. And he also was the sonne of the giant.
\p
\v 7 But when he defied Israel, Ionathan the sonne of Shimea Dauids brother, slew him.
\p
\v 8 These were borne vnto the Giant in Gath, and they fell by the hand of Dauid, and by the hand of his seruants.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 And Satan stoode vp against Israel, and prouoked Dauid to number Israel.
\p
\v 2 And Dauid saide to Ioab, and to the rulers of the people, Goe, number Israel from Beer-sheba eueu to Dan: and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.
\p
\v 3 And Ioab answered, The Lord make his people an hundred times so many moe as they bee: but, my lord the king, are they not al my lords seruants? why then doeth my lord require this thing? why will hee bee a cause of trespasse to Israel?
\p
\v 4 Neuerthelesse, the kings word preuailed against Ioab: wherefore Ioab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Ierusalem.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And Ioab gaue the summe of the number of the people vnto Dauid: and all they of Israel were a thousand thousand, and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Iudah was foure hundred threescore and ten thousand men, that drew sword.
\p
\v 6 But Leui and Beniamin counted hee not among them: for the kings word was abominable to Ioab.
\p
\v 7 And God was displeased with this thing, therefore he smote Israel.
\p
\v 8 And Dauid saide vnto God, I haue sinned greatly, because I haue done this thing: but uow, I beseech thee, doe away the iniquitie of thy seruant, for I haue done very foolishly.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And the Lord spake vnto Gad, Dauids Seer, saying,
\p
\v 10 Goe and tell Dauid, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I offer thee three things, choose thee one of them, that I may doe it vnto thee.
\p
\v 11 So Gad came to Dauid, and said vnto him, Thus saith the Lord, Choose thee
\p
\v 12 Either three yeeres famine, or three moneths to bee destroyed before thy foes (while that the sword of thine enemies ouertaketh thee) or else three dayes the sword of the Lord, euen the pestilence in the land, and the Angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore aduise thy selfe, what word I shall bring againe to him that sent me.
\p
\v 13 And Dauid said vnto Gad, I am in a great strait. Let mee fall now into the hand of the Lord (for very great are his mercies,) but let me not fall into the hand of man.
\p
\v 14 ¶ So the Lord sent pestilence vpon Israel: and there fell of Israel, seuentie thousand men.
\p
\v 15 And God sent an Angel vnto Ierusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the Lord beheld, and he repented him of the euill, and said to the Angel that destroyed, It is ynough, stay now thine hand. And the Angel of the Lord stood by the threshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite.
\p
\v 16 And Dauid lift vp his eyes, and saw the Angel of the Lord stand betweene the earth and the heauen, hauing a drawen sword in his hand stretched out ouer Ierusalem. Then Dauid and the Elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackecloth, fell vpon their faces.
\p
\v 17 And Dauid said vnto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbred? euen I it is that haue sinned, and done euill indeed, but as for these sheepe, what haue they done? Let thine hand, I pray thee, O Lord my God, be on me, and on my fathers house, but not on thy people, that they should bee plagued.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Then the Angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to Dauid, that Dauid should goe vp and set vp an Altar vnto the Lord, in the threshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite.
\p
\v 19 And Dauid went vp at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the Name of the Lord.
\p
\v 20 And Ornan turned backe and saw the Angel, and his foure sonnes with him, hid themselues. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
\p
\v 21 And as Dauid came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw Dauid, and went out of the threshing floore, and bowed himselfe to Dauid with his face to the ground.
\p
\v 22 Then Dauid saide to Ornan, Grant mee the place of this threshing floore, that I may build an Altar therein vnto the Lord: thou shalt grant it mee for the full price, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\p
\v 23 And Ornan saide vnto Dauid, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Loe, I giue thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meate offering, I giue it all.
\p
\v 24 And king Dauid said to Ornan; Nay, but I wil verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the Lord, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.
\p
\v 25 So Dauid gaue to Ornan for the place, sixe hundred shekels of gold by weight.
\p
\v 26 And Dauid built there an Altar vnto the Lord, and offered burnt offerings, and peace offerings, and called vpon the Lord, and hee answered him from heauen by fire vpon the Altar of burnt offering.
\p
\v 27 And the Lord commaunded the Angel, and hee put vp his sword againe into the sheath thereof.
\p
\v 28 ¶ At that time, when Dauid saw that the Lord had answered him in the threshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite, then he sacrificed there.
\p
\v 29 For the tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made in the wildernesse, and the Altar of the burnt offering were at that season, in the high place at Gibeon:
\p
\v 30 But Dauid could not goe before it to euquire of God; for he was afraid, because of the sword of the Angel of the Lord.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 Then Dauid said, This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the Altar of the burnt offering for Israel.
\p
\v 2 And Dauid commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel: and hee set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.
\p
\v 3 And Dauid prepared yron in abundance for the nailes for the doores of the gates, and for the ioynings, and brasse in abundance without weight;
\p
\v 4 Also Cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians, and they of Tyre, brought much Cedar wood to Dauid.
\p
\v 5 And Dauid said, Solomon my sonne is yong and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the Lord, must be exceeding magnificall, of fame and of glory throughout all countreys: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So Dauid prepared abundantly before his death.
\p
\v 6 ¶ Then hee called for Solomon his sonne, and charged him to build an house for the Lord God of Israel.
\p
\v 7 And Dauid saide to Solomon; My sonne, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house vnto the Name of the Lord my God.
\p
\v 8 But the word of the Lord came to mee, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great warres: thou shalt not build an house vnto my Name, because thou hast shed much blood vpon the earth in my sight.
\p
\v 9 Behold, a sonne shall bee borne to thee, who shall bee a man of rest, and I will giue him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shalbe Solomon, and I wil giue peace and quietnesse vnto Israel in his dayes.
\p
\v 10 Hee shall build an house for my Name, and he shal be my sonne, and I will be his father, and I will establish the throne of his kingdome ouer Israel for euer.
\p
\v 11 Now my sonne, The Lord be with thee, and prosper thou, and build the house of the Lord thy God, as he hath said of thee.
\p
\v 12 Onely the Lord giue thee wisedome and vnderstanding, and giue thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keepe the Law of the Lord thy God.
\p
\v 13 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfill the Statutes and Iudgements which the Lord charged Moses with, concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage, dread not, nor be dismayed.
\p
\v 14 Now beholde, in my trouble I haue prepared for the house of the Lord an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of siluer, and of brasse and yron without weight: (for it is in abundance) timber also and stone haue I prepared, and thou mayest adde thereto.
\p
\v 15 Moreouer, there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers, and workers of stone and timber, and all maner of cunning men for euery maner of worke:
\p
\v 16 Of the gold, the siluer, and the brasse, and the yron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the Lord be with thee.
\p
\v 17 ¶ Dauid also commanded all the Princes of Israel to helpe Solomon his sonne, saying,
\p
\v 18 Is not the Lord your God with you? and hath he not giuen you rest on euery side? for he hath giuen the inhabitants of the land into mine hand, and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people.
\p
\v 19 Now set your heart and your soule to seeke the Lord your God: arise therfore, and build ye the Sanctuary of the Lord God, to bring the Arke of the Couenant of the Lord, & the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the Name of the Lord.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 So when Dauid was old and full of dayes, he made Solomon his sonne king ouer Israel.
\p
\v 2 ¶ And he gathered together all the Princes of Israel, with the Priests and the Leuites.
\p
\v 3 Now the Leuites were numbred from the age of thirtie yeeres and vpward: and their number, by their polles, man by man, was thirtie and eight thousand.
\p
\v 4 Of which, twentie and foure thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the Lord: and sixe thousand were Officers and Iudges.
\p
\v 5 Moreouer, foure thousand were porters, and foure thousand praised the Lord with the instruments which I made (said Dauid) to praise therewith.
\p
\v 6 And Dauid diuided them into courses among the sonnes of Leui, namely Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Of the Gershonites were Laadan, and Shimei.
\p
\v 8 The sonnes of Laadan, the chiefe was Iehiel, and Zetham, and Ioel, three.
\p
\v 9 The sonnes of Shimei: Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chiefe of the fathers of Laadan.
\p
\v 10 And the sonnes of Shimei were: Iahath, Zina, and Ieush, and Beriah. These foure were the sonnes of Shimei.
\p
\v 11 And Iahath was the chiefe, and Ziza the second: but Ieush and Beriah had not many sonnes: therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their fathers house.
\p
\v 12 ¶ The sonnes of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, foure.
\p
\v 13 The sonnes of Amram: Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctifie the most holy things, he and his sonnes for euer, to burne incense before the Lord, to minister vnto him, and to blesse in his Name for euer.
\p
\v 14 Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sonnes were named of the tribe of Leui.
\p
\v 15 The sonnes of Moses were: Gershom and Eliezer.
\p
\v 16 Of the sonnes of Gershom Shebuel was the chiefe.

\p
\v 25 For Dauid sayd, The Lord God of Israel hath giuen rest vnto his people, that they may dwell in Ierusalem for euer.
\p
\v 26 And also vnto the Leuites: they shall no more cary the Tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the seruice thereof.
\p
\v 27 For by the last words of Dauid, the Leuites were numbred from twentie yeeres olde, and aboue:
\p
\v 28 Because their office was to wait on the sonnes of Aaron, for the seruice of the house of the Lord, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the worke of the seruice of the house of God:
\p
\v 29 Both for the shew-bread, and for the fine floure for meat offering, and for the vnleauened cakes, and for that which is baked in the panne, and for that which is fried, and for all maner of measures and size:

\p
\v 31 And to offer all burnt sacrifices vnto the Lord in the Sabbaths, in the new moones, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded vnto them continually before the Lord:
\p
\v 32 And that they should keepe the charge of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sonnes of Aaron their brethren, in the seruice of the house of the Lord.

\c 24
\p
\v 1 Now these are the diuisions of the sonnes of Aaron. The sonnes of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
\p
\v 2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: Therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the Priests office.
\p
\v 3 And Dauid distributed them, both Zadok of the sonnes of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sonnes of Ithamar, according to their offices in their seruice.
\p

\p
\v 5 Thus were they diuided by lot, one sort with another; for the gouernours of the Sanctuarie, and gouernours of the house of God, were of the sonnes of Eleazar, and of the sonnes of Ithamar.
\p
\v 6 And Shemaiah the sonne of Nathanael the Scribe, one of the Leuites, wrote them before the King and the Princes, and Zadok the Priest, and Ahimelech the sonne of Abiathar, and before the chiefe of the fathers of the priests and Leuites: one principall houshold being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.

\p
\v 3 But God said vnto me, Thou shalt not builde an house for my Name, because thou hast been a man of warre, and hast shed blood.
\p
\v 4 Howbeit, the Lord God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father, to be king ouer Israel for euer: for he hath chosen Iudah to be the ruler; & of the house of Iudah, the house of my father; and among the sonnes of my father, he liked me to make me king ouer all Israel:
\p
\v 5 And of all my sonnes (for the Lord hath giuen me many sonnes) hee hath chosen Solomon my sonne, to sit vpon the throne of the kingdome of the Lord ouer Israel.
\p
\v 6 And he said vnto me, Solomon thy sonne, hee shall build my house and my courts: for I haue chosen him to be my sonne, and I will be his father.
\p
\v 7 Moreouer, I will establish his kingdome for euer, if he be constant to do my commandements and my iudgements, as at this day.
\p
\v 8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the congregation of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, keepe, and seeke for all the commandements of the Lord your God, that ye may possesse this good land, and leaue it for an inheritance for your children after you, for euer.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And thou, Solomon my sonne, know thou the God of thy father, and serue him with a perfite heart, and with a willing minde: for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and vnderstandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seeke him, he will be found of thee, but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for euer.
\p
\v 10 Take heed now, for the Lord hath chosen thee to builde an house for the Sanctuarie: be strong, and doe it.

\p
\v 19 All this, sayd Dauid, the Lord made mee understand in writing by his hand vpon mee, euen all the workes of this paterne.
\p
\v 20 And Dauid said to Solomon his sonne, Be strong, and of good courage, and doe it: feare not, nor be dismayed, for the Lord God, euen my God, will be with thee; he will not faile thee, nor forsake thee, vntill thou hast finished all the worke for the seruice of the house of the Lord.

\c 29
\p
\v 1 Furthermore, Dauid the King said vnto all the congregation, Solomon my sonne, whome alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the worke is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the Lord God.
\p
\v 2 Now I haue prepared with all my might for the house of my God, the gold for things to be made of gold, the siluer for things of siluer, and the brasse for things of brasse, the yron for things of yron, and wood for things of wood, onix stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of diuers colours, and all maner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
\p

\p

\v 5 The gold for things of golde, and the siluer for things of siluer, and for all maner of worke to be made by the hands of Artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his seruice this day vnto the Lord?
\p
\v 6 ¶ Then the chiefe of the fathers and Princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captaines of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers ouer the Kings worke, offered willingly,
\p
\v 7 And gaue for the seruice of the house of God, of gold fiue thousand talents, and ten thousand drammes: and of siluer, ten thousand talents: and of brasse, eighteene thousand talents: and one hundred thousand talents of yron.
\p
\v 8 And they with whom precious stones were found, gaue them to the treasure of the house of the Lord, by the hand of Iehiel the Gershonite.
\p
\v 9 Then the people reioyced, for that they offred willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord: and Dauid the King also reioyced with great ioy.
\p
\v 10 ¶ Wherefore Dauid blessed the Lord before all the Congregation: and Dauid saide, Blessed bee thou, Lord God of Israel our father, for euer and euer.
\p
\v 11 Thine, O Lord, is the greatnes, and the power, and the glory, & the victorie, and the maiestie: for all that is in the heauen & in the earth, is thine: thine is the kingdome, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head aboue all.
\p
\v 12 Both riches, and honour come of thee, and thou reignest ouer all, and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is to make great, and to giue strength vnto all.
\p
\v 13 Now therefore, our God, wee thanke thee, and praise thy glorious Name.
\p
\v 14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine owne haue we giuen thee.
\p
\v 15 For we are strangers before thee, and soiourners, as were all our fathers: Our dayes on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.
\p
\v 16 O Lord our God, all this store that we haue prepared to build thee an house for thine holy Name, commeth of thine hand, and is all thine owne.
\p
\v 17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in vprightnesse. As for me, in the vprightnes of mine heart I haue willingly offered all these things: and now haue I seene with ioy, thy people which are present here, to offer willingly vnto thee.
\p
\v 18 O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and of Israel our fathers, keepe this for euer in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart vnto thee:
\p
\v 19 And giue vnto Solomon my sonne a perfect heart to keepe thy Commaundements, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to doe all these things, and to build the pallace, for the which I haue made prouision.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And Dauid said to all the Congregation: Nowe blesse the Lord your God. And all the Congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and bowed downe their heads, and worshipped the Lord, and the King.
\p
\v 21 And they sacrificed sacrifices vnto the Lord, & offered burnt offerings vnto the Lord on the morrow after that day, euen a thousand bullockes, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambes, with their drinke offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:
\p
\v 22 And did eate and drinke before the Lord on that day with great gladnesse, and they made Solomon the sonne of Dauid King the second time, and anointed him vnto the Lord to be the chiefe gouernour, and Zadok to be Priest.
\p
\v 23 Then Solomon sate on the throne of the Lord, as king in stead of Dauid his father, and prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
\p
\v 24 And all the princes and the mightie men, and all the sonnes likewise of king Dauid, submitted themselues vnto Solomon the King.
\p
\v 25 And the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed vpon him such royal maiestie, as had not bene on any king before him in Israel.
\p
\v 26 ¶ Thus Dauid the sonne of Iesse, reigned ouer all Israel.
\p
\v 27 And the time that he reigned ouer Israel, was fourtie yeeres. Seuen yeeres reigned hee in Hebron, and thirtie and three yeeres reigned hee in Ierusalem.
\p
\v 28 And he died in a good old age, full of dayes, riches and honour: and Solomon his sonne reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 29 Now the acts of Dauid the King first and last, behold, they are written in the booke of Samuel the Seer, and in the booke of Nathan the Prophet, and in the booke of Gad the Seer,
\p
\v 30 With all his reigne and his might, and the times that went ouer him, and ouer Israel, and ouer all the kingdomes of the countreys.
