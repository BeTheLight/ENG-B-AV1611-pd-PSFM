\p
\v 8 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speake euill of dignities.

\p
\v 11 Wo vnto them, for they haue gone in the way of Kain, and ranne greedily after the errour of Balaam, for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.

\v 12 These are spottes in your feasts of charitie, when they feast with you, feeding themselues without feare: cloudes they are without water, caried about of winds, trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twise dead, plucked vp by the rootes.
\p
\v 13 Raging waues of the sea, foming out their owne shame, wandring stars, to whom is reserued the blacknesse of darkenesse for euer.
\p
\v 14 And Enoch also, the seuenth from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord commeth with ten thousands of his Saints,
\p
\v 15 To execute iudgement vpon all, and to conuince all that are vngodly among them, of all their vngodly deeds which they haue vngodly committed, and of all their heard speaches, which vngodly sinners haue spoken against him.

\p
\v 18 How that they tolde you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walke after their own vngodly lustes.
\p
\v 19 These be they who separate themselues, sensual, hauing not the spirit.
\p

\p
\v 21 Keepe your selues in the loue of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Iesus Christ vnto eternall life.

\p
\v 25 To the onely wise God our Sauiour, be glory and maiestie, dominion and power, now and euer. Amen.
