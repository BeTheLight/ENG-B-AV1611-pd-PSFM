\c 1
\p
\v 1 The words of Nehemiah the sonne of Hachaliah. And it came to passe in the moneth Chisleu, in the twentieth yeere, as I was in Shushan the palace;
\p
\v 2 That Hanani, one of my brethren came, he and certaine men of Iudah, and I asked them concerning the Iewes that had escaped, which were left of the captiuitie, and concerning Ierusalem.
\p
\v 3 And they said vnto me, The remnant that are left of the captiuitie there in the prouince, are in great affliction and reproch: the wall of Ierusalem also is broken downe, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And it came to passe when I heard these words, that I sate downe and wept, and mourned certaine dayes, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heauen,
\p
\v 5 And said, I beseech thee, O Lord God of heauen, the great and terrible God, that keepeth couenant and mercie for them that loue him, and obserue his commandements:
\p
\v 6 Let thine eare now be attentiue, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest heare the prayer of thy seruant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy seruants, and confesse the sinnes of the children of Israel, which wee haue sinned against thee: both I, and my fathers house haue sinned.
\p
\v 7 We haue dealt very corruptly against thee, and haue not kept the commandements, nor the statutes, nor the iudgements, which thou commandedst thy seruant Moses.
\p
\v 8 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy seruant Moses, saying, If yee transgresse, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:
\p
\v 9 But if ye turne vnto me, and keepe my commandements, and doe them: though there were of you cast out vnto the vttermost part of the heauen, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them vnto the place that I haue chosen, to set my Name there.
\p
\v 10 Now these are thy seruants, and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.
\p
\v 11 O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine eare be attentiue to the prayer of thy seruant, and to the prayer of thy seruants, who desire to feare thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy seruant this day, and grant him mercie in the sight of this man. For I was the kings cup-bearer.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe, in the moneth Nisan, in the twentieth yeere of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I tooke vp the wine, and gaue it vnto the King: now I had not bene beforetime sad in his presence.
\p
\v 2 Wherefore the king said vnto me, Why is thy countenance sadde, seeing thou art not sicke? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,
\p
\v 3 And said vnto the king, Let the king liue for euer: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers Sepulchres, lyeth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?
\p
\v 4 Then the king said vnto me, For what doest thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heauen.
\p
\v 5 And I said vnto the king, If it please the king, and if thy seruant haue found fauour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me vnto Iudah vnto the City of my fathers sepulchres, that I may build it.
\p
\v 6 And the king saide vnto mee (the Queene also sitting by him) For how long shall thy iourney bee? and when wilt thou returne? So it pleased the king to send me, and I set him a time.
\p
\v 7 Moreouer I saide vnto the king, If it please the king, let letters be giuen mee to the gouernours beyond the Riuer, that they may conuey me ouer, till I come into Iudah;
\p
\v 8 And a letter vnto Asaph the keeper of the kings forrest, that he may giue me timber to make beames for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the Citie, and for the house that I shall enter into: And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God vpon me.
\p
\v 9 ¶ Then I came to the gouernours beyond the riuer, and gaue them the kings letters: (now the king had sent captaines of the army, and horsemen with me.)
\p
\v 10 When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the seruant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieued them exceedingly, that there was come a man, to seeke the welfare of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 11 So I came to Ierusalem, and was there three dayes.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And I arose in the night, I, and some few men with mee, neither tolde I any man what God had put in my heart to doe at Ierusalem: neither was there any beast with mee, saue the beast that I rode vpon.
\p
\v 13 And I went out by night, by the gate of the valley, euen before the dragon well, and to the doung-port, and viewed the walls of Ierusalem, which were broken downe, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.
\p
\v 14 Then I went on to the gate of the fountaine, and to the kings poole: but there was no place for the beast that was vnder me, to passe.
\p
\v 15 Then went I vp in the night by the brooke, and viewed the wall, and turned backe, and entred by the gate of the valley, and so returned.
\p
\v 16 And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did, neither had I as yet tolde it to the Iewes, nor to the Priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the worke.
\p
\v 17 ¶ Then said I vnto them, Yee see the distresse that we are in, how Ierusalem lieth waste, and the gates therof are burnt with fire: come, and let vs builde vp the wall of Ierusalem, that we be no more a reproch.
\p
\v 18 Then I told them of the hand of my God, which was good vpon me; as also the kings wordes that he had spoken vnto me. And they said, Let vs rise vp and builde. So they strengthened their hands for this good worke.
\p
\v 19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the seruant the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian heard it, they laughed vs to scorne, and despised vs, and said, What is this thing that yee doe? will ye rebell against the king?
\p
\v 20 Then answered I them, and said vnto them, The God of heauen, he will prosper vs, therefore wee his seruants will arise and build: But you haue no portion, nor right, nor memoriall in Ierusalem.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 Then Eliashib the hie priest, rose vp with his brethren the Priests, and they built the sheepe-gate, they sanctified it, & set vp the doores of it, euen vnto the towre of Meah they sanctified it, vnto the towre of Hananeel.
\p
\v 2 And next vnto him builded the men of Iericho: and next to them builded Zaccur the sonne of Imri.
\p
\v 3 But the fish-gate did the sonnes of Hassenaah build, who also laide the beames thereof, and set vp the doores thereof, the locks thereof, and the barres thereof.

\p
\v 5 And uext vnto them, the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their neckes to the worke of their Lord.
\p
\v 6 Moreouer the olde gate repaired Iehoiada the sonne of Paseah, and Meshullam the sonne of Besodaiah; they laid the beames thereof, and set vp the doores thereof, and the lockes thereof, and the barres thereof.
\p
\v 7 And next vnto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Iadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, vnto the throne of the gouernour on this side the Riuer.
\p
\v 8 Next vnto him repaired Uzziel the sonne of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths: next vnto him also repaired Hananiah, the sonne of one of the Apothecaries, and they fortified Ierusalem vnto the broad wall.
\p
\v 9 And next vnto them repaired Rephaiah the sonne of Hur, the ruler of the halfe part of Ierusalem.
\p
\v 10 And next vnto them repaired Iedaiah the sonne of Harumaph, euen ouer against his house: and next vnto him repaired Hattush the sonne of Hashabniah.
\p
\v 11 Malchiiah the sonne of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahath Moab, repaired the other piece, & the towre of the furnaces.
\p
\v 12 And next vnto him repaired Shallum the sonne of Halloesh the ruler of the halfe part of Ierusalem, hee, and his daughters.
\p
\v 13 The valley-gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set vp the doores thereof, the lockes thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall, vnto the doung-gate.
\p
\v 14 But the doung-gate repaired Malchiah the sonne of Rechab, the ruler of part of Beth-haccerem: hee built it, and set vp the doores thereof, the lockes thereof, and the barres thereof.
\p
\v 15 But the gate of the fountaine repaired Shallum the sonne of Col-hozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah: hee built it, and couered it, and set vp the doores thereof, the lockes thereof, and the barres thereof, and the wall of the poole of Siloah by the kings garden, and vnto the staires that goe downe from the citie of Dauid.
\p
\v 16 After him repaired Nehemiah the sonne of Azbuk, the ruler of the halfe part of Beth-zur, vnto the place ouer against the sepulchres of Dauid, and to the poole that was made, and vnto the house of the mightie.
\p
\v 17 After him repaired the Leuites, Rehum the sonne of Bani: next vnto him repaired Hashabiah the ruler of the halfe part of Keilah in his part.
\p
\v 18 After him repaired their brethren, Bauai, the sonne of Henadad the ruler of the halfe part of Keilah.
\p
\v 19 And next to him repaired Ezer the sonne of Ieshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece, ouer against the going vp to the armorie, at the turning of the wall.
\p
\v 20 After him Baruch the sonne of Zabbai, earnestly repaired the other piece, from the turning of the wall vnto the doore of the house of Eliashib the high Priest.
\p
\v 21 After him repaired Merimoth the sonne of Uriiah, the sonne of Koz, another piece, from the doore of the house of Eliashib, euen to the end of the house of Eliashib.
\p
\v 22 And after him repaired the Priests, the men of the plaine.
\p
\v 23 After him repaired Beniamin, and Hashub, ouer against their house: after him repaired Azariah the sonne of Maaseiah, the sonne of Ananiah, by his house.
\p
\v 24 After him repaired Binnui the sonne of Henadad, another piece from the house of Azariah, vnto the turning of the wall, euen vnto the corner.
\p
\v 25 Palal the sonne of Uzai, ouer against the turning of the wall, and the tower which lyeth out, from the kings hie house, that was by the court of the prison: after him, Pedaiah the sonne of Parosh.
\p
\v 26 Moreouer the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, vnto the place ouer against the water gate, toward the East, and the tower that lieth out.
\p
\v 27 After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, ouer against the great tower that lieth out, euen vnto the wall of Ophel.
\p
\v 28 From aboue the horsegate repaired the Priests, euery one ouer against his house.
\p

\p
\v 30 After him repaired Hananiah the sonne of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth sonne of Zalaph, another piece: after him repaired Meshullam, the sonne of Berechiah ouer against his chamber.
\p
\v 31 After him repaired Malchiah, the goldsmiths sonne, vnto the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, ouer against the gate Miphkad, and to the going vp of the corner.
\p
\v 32 And betweene the going vp of the corner vnto the sheepe-gate, repaired the gold-smithes and the merchants.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 But it came to passe, that when Sanballat heard, that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and tooke great indignation, and mocked the Iewes.
\p
\v 2 And he spake before his brethren, and the army of Samaria, and said, What doe these feeble Iewes? wil they fortifie themselues? will they sacrifice? wil they make an end in a day? wil they reuiue the stones, out of the heapes of the rubbish, which are burnt?
\p
\v 3 Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Euen that which they build, if a foxe goe vp, he shall euen breake downe their stone wall.
\p
\v 4 Heare, O our God, for we are despised: and turne their reproch vpon their owne head, and giue them for a pray, in the land of captiuitie.
\p
\v 5 And couer not their iniquitie, and let not their sinne bee blotted out from before thee: for they haue prouoked thee to anger before the builders.
\p
\v 6 So built we the wall, and all the wall was ioyned together vnto the halfe therof: for the people had a minde to worke.
\p
\v 7 ¶ But it came to passe that when Sanballat and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walles of Ierusalem were made vp, and that the breaches began to bee stopped, then they were very wroth,
\p
\v 8 And conspired all of them together, to come and to fight against Ierusalem, and to hinder it.
\p
\v 9 Neuertheles, we made our prayer vnto our God, and set a watch against them, day and night, because of them.
\p
\v 10 And Iudah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish, so that we are not able to build the wall.
\p
\v 11 And our aduersaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till wee come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the worke to cease.
\p
\v 12 And it came to passe that when the Iewes which dwelt by them, came, they said vnto vs ten time, From all places, whence yee shall returne vnto vs, they will be vpon you.
\p
\v 13 ¶ Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I euen set the people, after their families, with their swords, their speares, and their bowes.
\p
\v 14 And I looked, and rose vp, and said vnto the Nobles, and to the rulers, and to rest of the people, Bee not ye afraid of them: Remember the Lord which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sonnes and your daughters, your wiues & your houses.
\p
\v 15 And it came to passe when our enemies heard that it was knowen vnto vs, and God had brought their counsell to nought, that we returned all of vs to the wall, euery one vnto his worke.
\p
\v 16 And it came to passe from that time forth, that the halfe of my seruants wrought in the worke, and the other halfe of them held both the speares, the shields and the bowes, and the habergeons, and the rulers were behind all the house of Iudah.
\p
\v 17 They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, euery one with one of his hands wrought in the worke, and with the other hand held a weapon.
\p
\v 18 For the builders, euery one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded: and he that sounded the trumpet was by mee.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And I said vnto the Nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The worke is great and large, and wee are separated vpon the wall, one farre from another:
\p
\v 20 In what place therefore ye heare the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither vnto vs: our God shal fight for vs.
\p
\v 21 So wee laboured in the worke: and halfe of them held the speares, from the rising of the morning, til the starres appeared.
\p
\v 22 Likewise at the same time said I vnto the people, Let euery one, with his seruant, lodge within Ierusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to vs, and labour on the day.
\p
\v 23 So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my seruants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of vs put off our clothes, sauing that euery one put them off for washing.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 And there was a great crie of the people, and of their wiues, against their brethren the Iewes.
\p
\v 2 For there were that said, We, our sonnes, and our daughters are many: therefore wee take vp corne for them, that we may eat, and liue.
\p
\v 3 Some also there were that saide, We haue morgaged our landes, vineyards and houses, that we might buy corne, because of the dearth.
\p
\v 4 There were also that said, Wee haue borrowed money for the kings tribute, and that vpon our lands and vineyards.
\p
\v 5 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and loe, wee bring into bondage our sonnes and our daughters, to bee seruants, and some of our daughters are brought vnto bondage already, neither is it in our power to redeeme them: for other men haue our lands and vineyards.
\p
\v 6 ¶ And I was very angry, when I heard their crie, and these words.
\p
\v 7 Then I consulted with my selfe, and I rebuked the Nobles, and the rulers, and said vnto them, You exact vsurie, euery one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them:
\p
\v 8 And I said vnto them, We, after our abilitie, haue redeemed our brethren the Iewes, which were sold vnto the heathen; and will you euen sell your brethren? or shall they be sold vnto vs? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answere.
\p
\v 9 Also I said, It is not good that yee doe: ought yee not to walke in the feare of our God, because of the reproch of the heathen our enemies?
\p
\v 10 I likewise, and my brethren, and my seruants, might exact of them money and corne: I pray you let vs leaue off this vsurie.
\p
\v 11 Restore, I pray you, to them, euen this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliue-yards, and their houses, also the hundreth part of the money, and of the corne, the wine, and the oyle, that ye exact of them.
\p
\v 12 Then said they, Wee will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we doe, as thou sayest. Then I called the Priests, and tooke an oath of them, that they should doe according to this promise.
\p
\v 13 Also I shooke my lap, and said, So God shake out euery man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, euen thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the Congregation said, Amen, and praised the Lord. And the people did according to this promise.
\p
\v 14 ¶ Moreouer, from the time that I was appointed to be their gouernor in the land of Iudah, from the twentieth yeere euen vnto the two and thirtieth yere of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelue yeres, I and my brethren, haue not eaten the bread of the gouernour:
\p
\v 15 But the former gouernours that had bene before me, were chargeable vnto the people, and had taken of them bread, and wine, beside fourtie shekels of siluer, yea euen their seruants bare rule ouer the people: but so did not I, because of the feare of God.
\p
\v 16 Yea also I continued in the worke of this wall, neither bought wee any land: and all my seruants were gathered thither vnto the worke.
\p
\v 17 Moreouer, there were at my table, an hundred and fiftie of the Iewes and rulers, besides those that came vnto vs from among the heathen that are about vs.
\p
\v 18 Now that which was prepared for me daily, was one oxe, and sixe choice sheepe; also foules were prepared for mee, and once in ten dayes, store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the gouernour, because the bondage was heauy vpon this people.
\p
\v 19 Thinke vpon mee, my God, for good, according to all that I haue done for this people.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 Now it came to passe when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies heard, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein: (though at that time I had not set vp the doores vpon the gates,)
\p
\v 2 That Sanballat, and Geshem sent vnto me, saying, Come, let vs meet together in some one of the villages in the plaine of Ono: But they thought to doe me mischiefe.
\p
\v 3 And I sent messengers vnto them, saying, I am doing a great worke, so that I can not come down: why should the worke cease, whilest I leaue it, and come downe to you?
\p
\v 4 Yet they sent vnto me foure times, after this sort; and I answered them after the same maner.
\p
\v 5 Then sent Sanballat his seruant vnto me, in like manner, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand:
\p
\v 6 Wherein was written; It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu sayth it, that thou and the Iewes thinke to rebell: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their King, according to these words.
\p
\v 7 And thou hast also appointed Prophets to preach of thee at Ierusalem, saying, There is a King in Iudah. And now shall it be reported to the king, according to these wordes. Come now therefore, and let vs take counsell together.
\p
\v 8 Then I sent vnto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine owne heart.
\p
\v 9 For they all made vs afraid, saying, Their handes shall be weakened from the worke that it bee not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.
\p
\v 10 Afterward I came vnto the house of Shemaiah the sonne of Delaiah, the sonne of Mehetabel, who was shut vp, and he said, Let vs meet together in the house of God, within the Temple, and let vs shut the doores of the Temple; for they will come to slay thee, yea in the night wil they come to slay thee.
\p
\v 11 And I said, Should such a man as I, flee? and who is there, that being as I am, would goe into the Temple to saue his life? I will not goe in.
\p
\v 12 And loe, I perceiued that God had not sent him, but that he pronounced this prophecie against mee: for Tobiah, and Sanballat had hired him.
\p
\v 13 Therefore was hee hired, that I should be afraid, and doe so, and sinne, and that they might haue matter for an euill report, that they might reproch mee.
\p
\v 14 My God, thinke thou vpon Tobiah, and Sanballat, according to these their workes, and on the prophetesse Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would haue put me in feare.
\p
\v 15 ¶ So the wall was finished, in the twentie and fifth day of the moneth Elul, in fiftie and two dayes.
\p
\v 16 And it came to passe that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen, that were about vs, saw these things, they were much cast downe in their owne eyes: for they perceiued that this worke was wrought of our God.
\p
\v 17 ¶ Moreouer, in those dayes the nobles of Iudah sent many letters vnto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came vnto them.
\p
\v 18 For there were many in Iudah sworne vnto him: because hee was the sonne in law of Shechaniah the sonne of Arah, and his sonne Iohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam, the sonne of Berechiah.
\p
\v 19 Also they reported his good deeds before me, and vttered my wordes to him: and Tobiah sent letters to put me in feare.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 Now it came to passe when the wall was built, and I had set vp the doores; and the porters, and the singers, and the Leuites were appointed,
\p
\v 2 That I gaue my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge ouer Ierusalem (for hee was a faithfull man, and feared God aboue many.)
\p
\v 3 And I said vnto them, Let not the gates of Ierusalem be opened, vntill the Sunne bee hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doores, and barre them. And appoint watches of the inhabitants of Ierusalem, euery one in his wateh, and euery one to bee ouer against his house.
\p
\v 4 Now the city was large and great, but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And my God put into mine heart, to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, & the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogie. And I found a register of the genealogie of them which came vp at the first, and found written therein;
\p
\v 6 These are the children of the prouince, that went vp out of the captiuitie, of those that had beene caried away whom Nebuchadnezzar the King of Babylon had caried away, and came againe to Ierusalem and to Iudah, euery one vnto his citie:

\p
\v 61 And these were they which went vp also from Tel-Melah, Tel-Haresha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shewe their fathers house, nor their seede, whether they were of Israel.
\p
\v 62 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, sixe hundred fourtie and two.
\p
\v 63 ¶ And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai, which tooke one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name.
\p
\v 64 These sought their register, among those that were reckoned by genealogie, but it was not found: therfore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
\p
\v 65 And the Tirshatha said vnto them, that they should not eate of the most holy things, till there stood vp a priest with Urim and Thummim.
\p
\v 66 ¶ The whole congregation together, was fourtie and two thousand, three hundred and threescore:
\p
\v 67 Beside their man seruants, and their maid seruants, of whome there were seuen thousand, three hundred, thirtie and seuen: and they had two hundred fourtie and fiue singing men and singing women.

\p
\v 71 And some of the chiefe of the fathers gaue to the treasure of the worke twentie thousand drammes of golde, and two thousand and two hundred pound of siluer.
\p
\v 72 And that which the rest of the people gaue, was twentie thousand drammes of gold, and two thousand pound of siluer, and threescore and seuen priests garments.
\p
\v 73 So the priests, and the Leuites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities: And when the seuenth moneth came, the children of Israel were in their cities.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 And all the people gathered themselues together, as one man, into the street that was before the water gate, and they spake vnto Ezra the scribe, to bring the booke of the Law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel.
\p
\v 2 And Ezra the priest brought the Law before the Congregation, both of men and women, and all that could heare with vnderstanding, vpon the first day of the seuenth moneth.
\p
\v 3 And hee read therein before the street that was before the water gate, from the morning vntill midday, before the men and the women, and those that could vnderstand: And the eares of all the people were attentiue vnto the booke of the law.
\p
\v 4 And Ezra the scribe, stood vpon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose, and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand: and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
\p
\v 5 And Ezra opened the booke in the sight of all the people (for hee was aboue al the people) and when he opened it, all the people stood vp:
\p
\v 6 And Ezra blessed the Lord the great God: and al the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting vp their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the Lord, with their faces to the ground.
\p
\v 7 Also Ieshua and Bani, and Sherebiah, Iamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Iozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Leuites, caused the people to vnderstand the law: and the people stood in their place.
\p
\v 8 So they read in the booke, in the Law of God distinctly, and gaue the sense, and caused them to vnderstand the reading.
\p
\v 9 ¶ And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the Priest the Scribe, and the Leuites that taught the people, said vnto all the people, This day is holy vnto the Lord your God, mourne not, nor weepe: for all the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law.
\p
\v 10 Then hee sayd vnto them, Goe your way, eat the fat, & drinke the sweet, and send portions vnto them, for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy vnto our Lord: neither be ye sory, for the ioy of the Lord is your strength.
\p
\v 11 So the Leuites stilled all the people, saying, Holde your peace, for the day is holy, neither be ye grieued.
\p
\v 12 And all the people went their way to eate, and to drinke, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had vnderstood the wordes that were declared vnto them.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And on the second day were gathered together the chiefe of the fathers of all the people, the Priestes and the Leuites, vnto Ezra the Scribe, euen to vnderstand the wordes of the Law.
\p
\v 14 And they found written in the Law whith the Lord had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in boothes, in the feast of the seuenth moneth:
\p
\v 15 And that they should publish and proclaime in all their cities, and in Ierusalem, saying, Goe foorth vnto the mount, and fetch Oliue branches, and Pine branches, and Myrtle branches, and Palme branches, and branches of thicke trees, to make boothes, as it is written.
\p
\v 16 ¶ So the people went foorth, and brought them, and made themselues boothes, euery one vpon the roofe of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the streete of the water-gate, and in the streete of the gate of Ephraim.
\p
\v 17 And all the congregation of them that were come againe out of the captiuitie, made boothes, and sate vnder the boothes: for since the dayes of Ieshua the sonne of Nun, vnto that day, had not the children of Israel done so: and there was very great gladnesse.
\p
\v 18 Also day by day from the first day vnto the last day, he read in the booke of the Law of God: and they kept the feast seuen dayes, and on the eight day was a solemne assembly according vnto the maner.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 Now in the twentie and fourth day of this moneth, the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, & with sackclothes, and earth vpon them.
\p
\v 2 And the seede of Israel separated themselues from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sinnes, and the iniquities of their fathers.
\p
\v 3 And they stood vp in their place, and read in the booke of the Law of the Lord their God, one fourth part of the day, and another fourth part they confessed and worshipped the Lord their God.
\p
\v 4 ¶ Then stoode vp, vpon the staires of the Leuites, Ieshua and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cryed with a loude voice vnto the Lord their God.
\p
\v 5 Then the Leuites, Ieshua and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodiiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, sayde, Stand vp, and blesse the Lord your God for euer and euer, and blessed bee thy glorious Name, which is exalted aboue all blessing and praise.
\p
\v 6 Thou, euen thou art Lord alone, thou hast made heauen, the heauen of heauens, with all their hoste, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therin, and thou preseruest them all, and the hoste of heauen worshippeth thee.
\p
\v 7 Thou art the Lord the God, who diddest choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Caldees, and gauest him the name of Abraham:
\p
\v 8 And foundest his heart faithfull before thee, & madest a couenant with him, to giue the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Iebusites, and the Girgashites, to giue it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words, for thou art righteous,
\p
\v 9 And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the red Sea,
\p
\v 10 And shewedst signes and wonders vpon Pharaoh, and on all his seruants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudlie against them: so didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day.
\p
\v 11 And thou didst diuide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the drie land, and their persecutours thou threwest into the deepes, as a stone into the mightie waters.
\p
\v 12 Moreouer thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar, and in the night, by a pillar of fire, to giue them light in the way wherin they should go.
\p
\v 13 Thou camest downe also vpon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heauen, and gauest them right iudgements, and true lawes, good statutes and commandements:
\p
\v 14 And madest knowen vnto them thy holy Sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and lawes, by the hand of Moses thy seruant:
\p
\v 15 And gauest them bread from heauen for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rocke, for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should goe in to possesse the land, which thou hadst sworne to giue them.
\p
\v 16 But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkned not to thy commandements:
\p
\v 17 And refused to obey, neither were mindful of the wonders that thou didst among them: but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captaine to returne to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and mercifull, slow to anger, and of great kindnes, & forsookest them not.
\p
\v 18 Yea when they had made them a molten calfe, and said, This is thy God, that brought thee vp out of Egypt, and had wrought great prouocations:
\p
\v 19 Yet thou, in thy manifold mercies, forsookest them not in the wildernesse: the pillar of the cloude departed not from them by day, to leade them in the way, neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherin they should goe.
\p
\v 20 Thou gauest also thy good spirit, to instruct them, and withheldest not thy Manna from their mouth, and gauest them water for their thirst.
\p
\v 21 Yea fourtie yeeres diddest thou sustaine them in the wildernesse, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes wared not old, and their feet swelled not.
\p
\v 22 Moreouer, thou gauest them kingdomes and nations, and didst diuide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.
\p
\v 23 Their children also multipliedst thou as the starres of heauen, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should goe in to possesse it.
\p
\v 24 So the children went in, and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the lande, the Canaanites, and gauest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might doe with them, as they would.
\p
\v 25 And they tooke strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses ful of all goods, welles digged, vineyards, and Olive yards, and fruit trees in abundance: So they did eat and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselues in thy great goodnesse.
\p
\v 26 Neuerthelesse, they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backes, and slewe thy prophets, which testified against them to turne them to thee, and they wrought great prouocations.
\p
\v 27 Therefore thou deliueredst them into the hande of their enemies, who vexed them, & in the time of their trouble, when they cried vnto thee, thou heardest them from heauen: and according to thy manifold mercies, thou gauest them sauiours, who saued them out of the hand of their enemies.
\p
\v 28 But after they had rest, they did euill againe before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion ouer them: yet when they returned and cried vnto thee, thou heardest them from heauen, and many times didst thou deliuer them, according to thy mercies:
\p
\v 29 And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them againe vnto thy lawe: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not vnto thy commaundements, but sinned against thy iudgements, (which if a man doe, he shal liue in them) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their necke, and would not heare.
\p
\v 30 Yet many yeres diddest thou forbeare them, and testifiedst against them by the Spirit in thy Prophets: yet would they not giue eare: therefore gauest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.
\p
\v 31 Neuerthelesse, for thy great mercies sake, thou diddest not vtterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and mercifull God.
\p
\v 32 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mightie, and the terrible God, who keepest couenant and mercie: let not all the trouble seeme little before thee, that hath come vpon vs, on our Kings, on our Princes, & on our Priests, and on our Prophets, & on our fathers, & on al thy people, since the time of the Kings of Assyria, vnto this day.
\p
\v 33 Howbeit, thou art iust in all that is brought vpon vs, for thou hast done right, but we haue done wickedly:
\p
\v 34 Neither haue our kings, our Princes, our Priests, nor our fathers kept thy Law, nor hearkened vnto thy Commandements, and thy Testimonies, wherewith thou didst testifie against them.
\p
\v 35 For they haue not serued thee in their kingdome, and in thy great goodnesse that thou gauest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gauest before them, neither turned they from their wicked workes.
\p
\v 36 Behold, we are seruants this day; and for the land that thou gauest vnto our fathers, to eat the fruit thereof, and the good thereof, behold, wee are seruants in it.
\p
\v 37 And it yeeldeth much increase vnto the kings, whom thou hast set ouer vs, because of our sinnes: also they haue dominion ouer our bodies, and ouer our cattell, at their pleasure; and wee are in great distresse.
\p
\v 38 And because of all this, wee make a sure couenant, and write it, and our Princes, Leuites, and Priestes, seale vnto it.

\p
\v 28 ¶ And the rest of the people, the Priests, the Leuites, the Porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had separated themselues from the people of the lands, vnto the Law of God, their wiues, their sonnes, and their daughters, euery one hauing knowledge, and hauing vnderstanding.
\p
\v 29 They claue to their brethren their nobles, and entred into a curse, and into an oath to walke in Gods law, which was giuen by Moses the seruant of God, and to obserue and doe all the commandements of the Lord our Lord, and his Iudgements, and his statutes:
\p
\v 30 And that we would not giue our daughters vnto the people of the land, nor take their daughters for our sonnes.
\p
\v 31 And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the Sabbath day, to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the Sabbath, or on the holyday, and that wee would leaue the seuenth yeere, and the exaction of euerie debt.
\p
\v 32 Also we made ordinances for vs, to charge our selues yeerely, with the third part of a shekel, for the seruice of the house of our God,
\p
\v 33 For the shew-bread, and for the continuall meate-offering, and for the continuall burnt offering, of the Sabbaths, of the new moones, for the set-feastes, and for the holy things, and for the sin-offerings, to make an atonement for Israel, and for all the worke of the house of our God.
\p
\v 34 And we cast the lots among the priests, the Leuites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed, yeere by yeere, to burne vpon the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the law:
\p
\v 35 And to bring the first fruits of our ground, and the first fruites of all fruit of all trees, yeere by yeere, vnto the house of the Lord.
\p
\v 36 Also the first-borne of our sonnes, and of our cattell (as it is written in the lawe) and the firstlings of our heards, and of our flockes, to bring to the house of our God, vnto the priests that minister in the house of our God:
\p
\v 37 And that we should bring the first fruits of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all maner of trees, of wine and of oile, vnto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithes of our ground vnto the Leuites, that the same Leuites might haue the tithes, in all the cities of our tillage.
\p
\v 38 And the priest the sonne of Aaron, shall be with the Leuites, when the Leuites take tithes, and the Leuites shal bring vp the tithe of the tithes vnto the house of our God, to the chambers into the treasure house.
\p
\v 39 For the children of Israel, and the children of Leui, shall bring the offering of the corne, of the new wine, and the oyle, vnto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuarie, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers, and we will not forsake the house of our God.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 And the rulers of the people dwelt at Ierusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of tenne, to dwell in Ierusalem, the holy citie, and nine parts to dwell in other cities.
\p
\v 2 And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered themselues, to dwell at Ierusalem.
\p
\v 3 ¶ Now these are the chiefe of the prouince that dwelt in Ierusalem: but in the cities of Iudah dwelt euerie one in his possession in their cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and the Leuites, and the Nethinims, and the children of Solomons seruants.

\p
\v 21 But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha, and Gispa were ouer the Nethinims.

\p
\v 24 And Pethahiah the sonne of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the sonne of Iudah, was at the kings hand in all matters concerning the people.

\v 4 Iddo, Ginnetho, Abiiah,
\p
\v 5 Miamin, Madish, Bilgah,
\p
\v 6 Shemaiah, & Ioiarib, Iedaiah,
\p
\v 7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Iedaiah: these were the chiefe of the Priests, and of their brethren in the dayes of Ieshua.
\p
\v 8 Moreouer the Leuites: Ieshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Iudah, and Mattaniah, which was ouer the thankesgiuing, he and his brethren.
\p
\v 9 Also Bakbukiah, and Unni; their brethren, were ouer against them in the watches.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And Ieshua begate Ioiakim, Ioiakim also begate Eliashib, and Eliashib begate Ioiada,
\p
\v 11 And Ioiada begate Ionathan, and Ionathan begate Iaddua.
\p
\v 12 And in the dayes of Ioiakim, were Priests the chiefe of the fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah: of Ieremiah, Hananiah:
\p
\v 13 Of Ezra, Meshullam: of Amariah, Iehohanan:
\p
\v 14 Of Melicu, Ionathan: of Shebaniah, Ioseph:
\p
\v 15 Of Harim, Adna: of Meraioth, Helkai:
\p
\v 16 Of Iodo, Zechariah: of Ginnethon, Meshullam:
\p
\v 17 Of Abijah, Zichri: of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai:
\p
\v 18 Of Bilgah, Shammua: of Shemaiah, Iehonathan:
\p
\v 19 And of Ioiarib, Mattenai: of Iedaiah, Uzzi:
\p
\v 20 Of Sallai, Kallai: of Amok, Eber:
\p
\v 21 Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah: of Iedaiah, Nethanael.
\p
\v 22 ¶ The Leuites in the dayes of Eliashib, Ioiada, and Iohanan, and Iaddua, were recorded chiefe of the fathers: also the Priests, to the reigne of Darius the Persian.
\p
\v 23 The sonnes of Leui, the chiefe of the fathers, were written in the booke of the Chronicles, euen vntill the dayes of Iohanan the sonne of Eliashib.
\p
\v 24 And the chiefe of the Leuites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Ieshua the sonne of Kadmiel, with their brethren ouer against them, to praise and to giue thankes, according to the commandement of Dauid the man of God, ward ouer against ward.
\p
\v 25 Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the ward, at the thresholds of the gates.
\p
\v 26 These were in the dayes of Ioiakim, the sonne of Ieshua, the sonne of Iozadak, and in the dayes of Nehemiah the gouernour, and of Ezra the Priest, the Scribe.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And at the dedication of the wall of Ierusalem, they sought the Leuites out of all their places, to bring them to Ierusalem, to keepe the dedication with gladnesse, both with thankesgiuings and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harpes.
\p
\v 28 And the sonnes of the Singers gathered themselues together, both out of the plaine countrey round about Ierusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi.
\p
\v 29 Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba, and Azmaueth: for the Singers had builded them villages round about Ierusalem.
\p
\v 30 And the Priests and the Leuites purified themselues, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
\p
\v 31 Then I brought vp the princes of Iudah vpon the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gaue thankes, whereof one went on the right hand vpon the wall toward the dounggate:
\p
\v 32 And after them went Hoshaiah, and halfe of the Princes of Iudah,
\p
\v 33 And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
\p
\v 34 Iudah, and Beniamin, and Shemaiah, and Ieremiah,
\p
\v 35 And certaine of the Priests sonnes with trumpets: namely, Zechariah the sonne of Ionathan, the sonne of Shemaiah, the sonne of Mattaniah, the sonne of Michaiah, the sonne of Zaccur, the sonne of Asaph:
\p
\v 36 And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Asarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanael, and Iudah, Hanani, with the musicall instruments of Dauid the man of God; and Ezra the Scribe before them.
\p
\v 37 And at the fountaine-gate, which was ouer against them, they went vp by the staires of the citie of Dauid, at the going vp of the wall, aboue the house of Dauid, euen vnto the water-gate, Eastward.
\p
\v 38 And the other company of them that gaue thankes, went ouer against them, and I after them, and the halfe of the people vpon the wall, from beyond the towre of the fornaces, euen vnto the broad wall,
\p
\v 39 And from aboue the gate of Ephraim, and aboue the olde gate, and aboue the fish-gate, and the towre of Hananeel, and the towre of Meah, euen vnto the sheepegate; and they stood still in the prison gate.
\p
\v 40 So stood the two companies of them that gaue thankes in the house of God, and I, and the halfe of the rulers with me:
\p
\v 41 And the Priests: Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zachariah, and Hananiah with trumpets:
\p
\v 42 And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Iehohanan, and Malchiiah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the Singers sang loud, with Iezrahiah their ouerseer.
\p
\v 43 Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and reioyced; for God had made them reioyce with great ioy: the wiues also and the children reioyced: so that the ioy of Ierusalem was heard euen afarre off.
\p
\v 44 ¶ And at that time were some appointed ouer the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Leuites: for Iudah reioyced for the Priests, & for the Leuites that waited.
\p
\v 45 And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandement of Dauid, and of Solomon his sonne.
\p
\v 46 For in the dayes of Dauid and Asaph of old, there were chiefe of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiuing vnto God.
\p
\v 47 And all Israel in the dayes of Zerubbabel, and in the dayes of Nehemiah, gaue the portions of the singers, and the porters, euery day his portion, and they sanctified holy things vnto the Leuites, and the Leuites sanctified them vnto the children of Aaron.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 On that day they read in the booke of Moses in the audience of the people, and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the Congregation of God for euer,
\p
\v 2 Because they met not the children of Israel with bread, and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.
\p
\v 3 Now it came to passe when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And before this Eliashib the priest hauing the ouersight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied vnto Tobiah:
\p
\v 5 And hee had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat offrings, the frankincense and the vessels, and the tithes of the corne, the new wine, and the oile, which was commanded to be giuen to the Leuites, and the singers, and the porters, and the offerings of the priests.
\p
\v 6 But in all this time was not I at Ierusalem: for in the two and thirtieth yeere of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, came I vnto the king, and after certaine dayes, obtained I leaue of the King:
\p
\v 7 And I came to Ierusalem, and vnderstood of the euil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
\p
\v 8 And it grieued me sore, therefore I cast foorth all the houshold stuffe of Tobiah out of the chamber:
\p
\v 9 Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers, and thither brought I againe the vessels of the house of God, with the meate offering, and the frankincense.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And I perceiued that the portions of the Leuites had not beene giuen them: for the Leuites and the singers that did the worke, were fled euery one to his field.
\p
\v 11 Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
\p
\v 12 Then brought all Iudah the tithe of the corne, and the new wine, and the oyle, vnto the treasuries.
\p
\v 13 And I made treasurers ouer the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Leuites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the sonne of Zaccur, the sonne of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithfull, and their office was to distribute vnto their brethren.
\p
\v 14 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds, that I haue done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.
\p
\v 15 ¶ In those dayes sawe I in Iudah, some treading wine presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaues, and lading asses, as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all maner of burdens, which they brought into Ierusalem on the Sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they solde victuals.
\p
\v 16 There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish and all maner of ware, and solde on the Sabbath vnto the children of Iudah, and in Ierusalem.
\p
\v 17 Then I contended with the Nobles of Iudah, and sayd vnto them, What euill thing is this that ye doe, and profane the Sabbath day?
\p
\v 18 Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this euill vpon vs, and vpon this citie? yet ye bring more wrath vpon Israel, by profaning the Sabbath.
\p
\v 19 And it came to passe, that when the gates of Ierusalem beganne to be darke before the Sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the Sabbath: and some of my seruants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the Sabbath day.
\p
\v 20 So the merchants, and sellers of all kinde of ware, lodged without Ierusalem once or twice.
\p
\v 21 Then I testified against them, and said vnto them, Why lodge yee about the wall? If ye doe so againe, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the Sabbath.
\p
\v 22 And I commanded the Leuites, that they should cleanse themselues, and that they should come and keepe the gates, to sanctifie the Sabbath day: Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me, according to the greatnesse of thy mercie.
\p
\v 23 ¶ In those dayes also sawe I Iewes that had maried wiues of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:
\p
\v 24 And their children spake halfe in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speake in the Iewes language, but according to the language of ech people.
\p
\v 25 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certeine of them, and pluckt off their haire, and made them sweare by God, saying, Yee shall not giue your daughters vnto their sonnes, nor take their daughters vnto your sonnes, or for your selues.
\p
\v 26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sinne by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloued of his God, and God made him king ouer all Israel: neuerthelesse, euen him did outlandish women cause to sinne.
\p
\v 27 Shall wee then hearken vnto you, to doe all this great euill, to transgresse against our God, in marrying strange wiues?
\p
\v 28 And one of the sonnes of Ioiada, the sonne of Eliashib the high Priest, was sonne in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therfore I chased him from me.
\p
\v 29 Remember them, O my God, because they haue defiled the Priesthood, and the couenant of the Priesthood, and of the Leuites.
\p
\v 30 Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the Priests and the Leuites, euery one in his businesse:
\p
\v 31 And for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
