\h1 JOB 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Iob, and that man was perfect and vpright, and one that feared God, and eschewed euill.
\p
\v 2 And there were borne vnto him seuen sonnes, and three daughters.
\p
\v 3 His substance also was seuen thousand sheepe, and three thousand camels, and fiue hundred yoke of oxen, and fiue hundred shee asses, and a very great houshold; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East.
\p
\v 4 And his sonnes went and feasted in their houses, euery one his day, and sent and called for their three sisters, to eate and to drinke with them.
\p
\v 5 And it was so, when the dayes of their feasting were gone about, that Iob sent and sanctified them, and rose vp early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: For Iob said, It may be that my sonnes haue sinned, and cursed God in their hearts: Thus did Iob continually.
\p
\v 6 ¶ Now there was a day, when the sons of God came to present themselues before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.
\p
\v 7 And the Lord said vnto Satan, Whence commest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and sayde, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking vp and downe in it.
\p
\v 8 And the Lord sayd vnto Satan, Hast thou considered my seruant Iob, that there is none like him in the earth? a perfect and an vpright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth euill?
\p
\v 9 Then Satan answered &thorn;e Lord, and sayd, Doeth Iob feare God for nought?
\p
\v 10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on euery side? thou hast blessed the worke of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
\p
\v 11 But put foorth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
\p
\v 12 And the Lord said vnto Satan, Behold, all that hee hath is in thy power, onely vpon himselfe put not foorth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And there was a day, when his sonnes and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house:
\p
\v 14 And there came a messenger vnto Iob, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them,
\p
\v 15 And the Sabeans fell vpon them, and tooke them away: yea they haue slaine the seruants with the edge of the sword, and I onely am escaped alone, to tell thee.
\p
\v 16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heauen, and hath burnt vp the sheepe, and the seruants, and consumed them, and I onely am escaped alone, to tell thee.
\p
\v 17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Caldeans made out three bands, and fell vpon the camels, and haue caried them away, yea, and slaine the seruants with the edge of the sword, and I onely am escaped alone, to tell thee.
\p
\v 18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, & said, Thy sonnes, and thy daughters, were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house.
\p
\v 19 And beholde, there came a great winde from the wildernes, and smote the foure corners of the house, and it fell vpon the yong men, and they are dead, and I onely am escaped alone to tell thee.
\p
\v 20 Then Iob arose, and rent his mantle, and shaued his head, and fell downe vpon the ground and worshipped,
\p
\v 21 And said, Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked shall I returne thither: the Lord gaue, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord.
\p
\v 22 In all this Iob sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 Againe there was a day when the sonnes of God came to present themselues before the Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himselfe before the Lord.
\p
\v 2 And the Lord said vnto Satan, From whence commest thou? And Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to & fro in the earth, and from walking vp and downe in it.
\p
\v 3 And the Lord said vnto Satan, Hast thou considered my seruant Iob, that there is none like him in the earth; a perfect and an vpright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth euill? and still hee holdeth fast his integritie, although thou moouedst mee against him, to destroy him without cause.
\p
\v 4 And Satan answered the Lord, and said, Skinne for skinne, yea all that a man hath, wil he giue for his life.
\p
\v 5 But put foorth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
\p
\v 6 And the Lord said vnto Satan, Behold, hee is in thine hand, but saue his life.
\p
\v 7 ¶ So went Satan foorth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Iob with sore biles, from the sole of his foote vnto his crowne.
\p
\v 8 And hee tooke him a potsheard to scrape himselfe withall; and hee sate downe among the ashes.
\p
\v 9 ¶ Then saide his wife vnto him, Doest thou still reteine thine integritie? Curse God, and die.
\p
\v 10 But he said vnto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh; what? shall wee receiue good at the hand of God, and shall wee not receiue euill? In all this did not Iob sinne with his lippes.
\p
\v 11 ¶ Now when Iobs three friends heard of all this euill, that was come vpon him, they came euery one from his owne place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they had made an appointment together to come to mourne with him, and to comfort him.
\p
\v 12 And when they lift vp their eyes afarre off, and knew him not, they lifted vp their voice, and wept; and they rent euery one his mantle, and sprinckled dust vpon their heades toward heauen.
\p
\v 13 So they sate downe with him vpon the ground seuen dayes, and seuen nights, and none spake a word vnto him; for they saw that his griefe was very great.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 After this, opened Iob his mouth, and cursed his day.
\p
\v 2 And Iob spake, and said,
\p
\v 3 Let the day perish, wherein I was borne, and the night in which it was said, There is a man-childe conceiued.
\p
\v 4 Let that day bee darkenesse, let not God regard it from aboue, neither let the light shine vpon it.
\p
\v 5 Let darkenes and the shadowe of death staine it, let a cloud dwell vpon it, let the blacknes of the day terrifie it.
\p
\v 6 As for that night, let darkenesse seaze vpon it, let it not be ioyned vnto the dayes of the yeere, let it not come into the number of the moneths.
\p
\v 7 Loe, let that night be solitarie, let no ioyfull voice come therein.
\p
\v 8 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise vp their mourning.
\p
\v 9 Let the starres of the twilight thereof be darke, let it looke for light, but haue none, neither let it see the dawning of the day:
\p
\v 10 Because it shut not vp the doores of my mothers wombe, nor hid sorrowe from mine eyes.
\p
\v 11 Why died I not from the wombe? why did I not giue vp the ghost when I came out of the bellie?
\p
\v 12 Why did the knees preuent mee? or why the breasts, that I should sucke?
\p
\v 13 For now should I haue lien still and beene quiet, I should haue slept; then had I bene at rest,
\p
\v 14 With Kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for themselues,
\p
\v 15 Or with Princes that had golde, who filled their houses with siluer:
\p
\v 16 Or as an hidden vntimely birth, I had not bene; as infants which neuer saw light.
\p
\v 17 There the wicked cease from troubling: and there the wearie be at rest.
\p
\v 18 There the prisoners rest together, they heare not the voice of the oppressour.
\p
\v 19 The small and great are there, and the seruant is free from his master.
\p
\v 20 Wherefore is light giuen to him that is in misery, and life vnto the bitter in soule?
\p
\v 21 Which long for death, but it commeth not, and dig for it more then for hid treasures:
\p
\v 22 Which reioice exceedingly, and are glad when they can finde the graue?
\p
\v 23 Why is light giuen to a man, whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
\p
\v 24 For my sighing commeth before I eate, and my roarings are powred out like the waters.
\p
\v 25 For the thing which I greatly feared is come vpon me, and that which I was afraid of, is come vnto me.
\p
\v 26 I was not in safetie, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet: yet trouble came.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, and said,
\p
\v 2 If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieued? But who can withhold himselfe from speaking?
\p
\v 3 Beholde, Thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weake hands.
\p
\v 4 Thy words haue vpholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
\p
\v 5 But now it is come vpon thee, and thou faintest, it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
\p
\v 6 Is not this thy feare, thy confidence; the vprightnesse of thy wayes and thy hope?
\p
\v 7 Remember, I pray thee, who euer perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
\p
\v 8 Euen as I haue seene, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickednsse, reape the same.
\p
\v 9 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
\p
\v 10 The roaring of the Lyon, and the voice of the fierce Lyon, and the teeth of the yong Lyons are broken.
\p
\v 11 The old Lyon perisheth for lacke of pray, and the stout Lyons whelpes are scattered abroad.
\p
\v 12 Nowe a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine eare receiued a litle thereof.
\p
\v 13 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deepe sleepe falleth on men:
\p
\v 14 Feare came vpon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
\p
\v 15 Then a spirit passed before my face: the haire of my flesh stood vp.
\p
\v 16 It stood still, but I could not discerne the forme thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voyce, saying,
\p
\v 17 Shall mortall man be more iust then God? shall a man bee more pure then his maker?
\p
\v 18 Behold, hee put no trust in his seruants; and his Angels hee charged with folly:
\p
\v 19 Howe much lesse on them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth.
\p
\v 20 They are destroyed from morning to euening: they perish for euer, without any regarding it.
\p
\v 21 Doeth not their excellencie which is in them, goe away? they die, euen without wisedome.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 Call now, if there be any that wil answere thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turne?
\p
\v 2 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and enuy slayeth the silly one.
\p
\v 3 I haue seene the foolish taking roote: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
\p
\v 4 His children are farre from safetie, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliuer them.
\p
\v 5 Whose haruest the hungry eateth vp, and taketh it euen out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth vp their substance.
\p
\v 6 Although affliction commeth not forth of the dust, neither doeth trouble spring out of the ground:
\p
\v 7 Yet man is borne vnto trouble, as the sparkes flie vpward.
\p
\v 8 I would seeke vnto God, and vnto God would I commit my cause:
\p
\v 9 Which doth great things & vnsearchable: marueilous things without number.
\p
\v 10 Who giueth raine vpon the earth, and sendeth waters vpon the fields:
\p
\v 11 To set vp on high those that be low; that those which mourne, may be exalted to safetie.
\p
\v 12 Hee disappointeth the deuices of the craftie, so that their hands cannot performe their enterprise.
\p
\v 13 He taketh the wise in their owne craftinesse: and the counsell of the froward is caried headlong.
\p
\v 14 They meete with darkenesse in the day time, and grope in the noone day as in the night.
\p
\v 15 But he saueth the poore from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mightie.
\p
\v 16 So the poore hath hope, and iniquitie stoppeth her mouth.
\p
\v 17 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almightie.
\p
\v 18 For he maketh sore, and bindeth vp: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
\p
\v 19 Hee shall deliuer thee in sixe troubles, yea in seuen there shall no euill touch thee.
\p
\v 20 In famine he shall redeeme thee from death: and in warre from the power of the sword.
\p
\v 21 Thou shalt be hidde from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction, when it commeth.
\p
\v 22 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
\p
\v 23 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
\p
\v 24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall bee in peace; and thou shalt visite thy habitation, and shalt not sinne.
\p
\v 25 Thou shalt know also that thy seede shalbe great, and thine offspring as the grasse of the earth.
\p
\v 26 Thou shalt come to thy graue in a full age, like as a shocke of corne commeth in, in his season.
\p
\v 27 Loe this, wee haue searched it, so it is; heare it, and know thou it for thy good.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 But Iob answered, and sayd,
\p
\v 2 Oh that my griefe were throughly weighed, and my calamitie layd in the balances together.
\p
\v 3 For now it would be heauier then the sand of the sea, therefore my words are swallowed vp.
\p
\v 4 For the arrowes of the Almightie are within me, the poyson whereof drinketh vp my spirit: the terrors of God doe set themselues in aray against mee.
\p
\v 5 Doeth the wilde asse bray when he hath grasse? or loweth the oxe ouer his fodder?
\p
\v 6 Can that which is vnsauery, bee eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egge?
\p
\v 7 The things that my soule refused to touch, are as my sorrowfull meat.
\p
\v 8 O that I might haue my request! and that God would graunt mee the thing that I long for!
\p
\v 9 Euen that it would please God to destroy mee, that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off.
\p
\v 10 Then should I yet haue comfort, yea I would harden my selfe in sorrow; let him not spare, for I haue not concealed the words of the holy One.
\p
\v 11 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine ende, that I should prolong my life?
\p
\v 12 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brasse?
\p
\v 13 Is not my helpe in me? and is wisedome driuen quite from me?
\p
\v 14 To him that is afflicted, pitie should be shewed from his friend; But he forsaketh the feare of the Almighty.
\p
\v 15 My brethren haue delt deceitfully as a brooke, & as the streame of brookes they passe away,
\p
\v 16 Which are blackish by reason of the yce, and wherein the snow is hid:
\p
\v 17 What time they waxe warme, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
\p
\v 18 The pathes of their way are turned aside; they goe to nothing, and perish.
\p
\v 19 The troupes of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
\p
\v 20 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
\p
\v 21 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting downe, and are afraid.
\p
\v 22 Did I say, Bring vnto mee? or giue a reward for me of your substance?
\p
\v 23 Or deliuer me from the enemies hand, or redeeme me from the hand of the mighty?
\p
\v 24 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause mee to vnderstand wherein I haue erred.
\p
\v 25 How forcible are right wordes? but what doeth your arguing reproue?
\p
\v 26 Do ye imagine to reproue words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as winde?
\p
\v 27 Yea, ye ouerwhelme the fatherlesse, and you digge a pit for your friend.
\p
\v 28 Now therefore be content, looke vpon mee, for it is euident vnto you, if I lie.
\p
\v 29 Returne, I pray you, let it not be iniquitie; yea returne againe: my righteousnesse is in it.
\p
\v 30 Is there iniquitie in my tongue? cannot my taste discerne peruerse things?

\c 7
\p
\v 1 Is there not an appointed time to man vpon earth? are not his dayes also like the dayes of an hireling?
\p
\v 2 As a seruant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his worke:
\p
\v 3 So am I made to possesse moneths of vanitie, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
\p
\v 4 When I lie downe, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro, vnto the dawning of the day.
\p
\v 5 My flesh is cloathed with wormes and clods of dust, my skinne is broken, and become loathsome.
\p
\v 6 My dayes are swifter then a weauers shuttle, and are spent without hope.
\p
\v 7 O remember that my life is winde: mine eye shall no more see good.
\p
\v 8 The eye of him that hath seene me, shall see mee no more: thine eyes are vpon me, and I am not.
\p
\v 9 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth downe to the graue, shall come vp no more.
\p
\v 10 Hee shall returne no more to his house: neither shall his place know him any more.
\p
\v 11 Therefore I will not refraine my mouth, I wil speake in the anguish of my spirit, I will complaine in the bitternesse of my soule.
\p
\v 12 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch ouer me?
\p
\v 13 When I say, My bed shal comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint:
\p
\v 14 Then thou skarest mee with dreames, and terrifiest me through visions.
\p
\v 15 So that my soule chooseth strangling: and death rather then my life.
\p
\v 16 I loath it, I would not liue alway: let me alone, for my dayes are vanitie.
\p
\v 17 What is man, that thou shouldest magnifie him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart vpon him?
\p
\v 18 And that thou shouldest visite him euery morning, and trie him euery moment?
\p
\v 19 How long wilt thou not depart from me? nor let me alone till I swallow downe my spittle?
\p
\v 20 I haue sinned, what shall I doe vnto thee, O thou preseruer of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to my selfe?
\p
\v 21 And why doest thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquitie? for now shall I sleepe in the dust, and thou shalt seeke me in the morning, but I shall not be.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
\p
\v 2 How long wilt thou speake these things? and how long shall the wordes of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
\p
\v 3 Doth God peruert iudgement? or doth the Almightie peruert iustice?
\p
\v 4 If thy children haue sinned against him, and he haue cast them away for their transgression:
\p
\v 5 If thou wouldest seeke vnto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almightie:
\p
\v 6 If thou wert pure and vpright, surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousnes prosperous.
\p
\v 7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
\p
\v 8 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thy selfe to the search of their fathers.
\p
\v 9 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our dayes vpon earth are a shadow.)
\p
\v 10 Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, & vtter words out of their heart?
\p
\v 11 Can the rush growe vp without myre? can the flag growe without water?
\p
\v 12 Whilest it is yet in his greennesse, and not cut downe, it withereth before any other herbe.
\p
\v 13 So are the paths of all that forget God, and the hypocrites hope shall perish:
\p
\v 14 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spiders web.
\p
\v 15 He shall leane vpon his house, but it shall not stand: he shal hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
\p
\v 16 He is greene before the sunne, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
\p
\v 17 His roots are wrapped about the heape, and seeth the place of stones.
\p
\v 18 If he destroy him from his place, then it shal denie him, saying, I haue not seene thee.
\p
\v 19 Beholde, this is the ioy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
\p
\v 20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will hee helpe the euill doers:
\p
\v 21 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with reioycing.
\p
\v 22 They that hate thee shall be cloathed with shame, and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 Then Iob answered, and said,
\p
\v 2 I know it is so of a trueth: but howe should man be iust with God.
\p
\v 3 If he will contend with him, he cannot answere him one of a thousand.
\p
\v 4 He is wise in heart, and mightie in strength: who hath hardened himselfe against him, and hath prospered?
\p
\v 5 Which remoueth the mountains, and they know not: which ouerturneth them in his anger:
\p
\v 6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, & the pillars thereof tremble:
\p
\v 7 Which commandeth the Sunne, and it riseth not: and sealeth vp the starres.
\p
\v 8 Which alone spreadeth out the heauens, and treadeth vpon the waues of the Sea.
\p
\v 9 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion and Pleiades, and the chambers of the South.
\p
\v 10 Which doeth great things past finding out, yea and wonders without number.
\p
\v 11 Loe, hee goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceiue him not.
\p
\v 12 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say vnto him, What doest thou?
\p
\v 13 If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers doe stoupe vnder him.
\p
\v 14 How much lesse shall I answere him, and choose out my words to reason with him?
\p
\v 15 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answere, but I would make supplication to my Iudge.
\p
\v 16 If I had called, and had answered me, yet would I not beleeue that he had hearkened vnto my voice:
\p
\v 17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
\p
\v 18 Hee will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitternesse.
\p
\v 19 If I speake of strength, loe, hee is strong: and if of iudgement, who shall set me a time to pleade?
\p
\v 20 If I iustifie my selfe, mine owne mouth shall condemne me: If I say, I am perfect, it shall also prooue me peruerse.
\p
\v 21 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soule: I would despise my life.
\p
\v 22 This is one thing, therefore I said it; he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
\p
\v 23 If the scourge slay suddenly, hee will laugh at the triall of the innocent.
\p
\v 24 The earth is giuen into the hand of the wicked: he couereth the faces of the Iudges thereof; if not, where, and who is hee?
\p
\v 25 Now my dayes are swifter then a Poste: they flee away, they see no good.
\p
\v 26 They are passed away as the ships: as the Eagle that hasteth to the pray.
\p
\v 27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leaue off my heauinesse, and comfort my selfe.
\p
\v 28 I am afraid of all my sorrowes, I know that thou wilt not holde me innocent.
\p
\v 29 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vaine?
\p
\v 30 If I wash my selfe with snow water, and make my handes neuer so cleane:
\p
\v 31 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine owne clothes shall abhorre me.
\p
\v 32 For he is not a man as I am, that I should answere him, and we should come together in iudgement.
\p
\v 33 Neither is there any dayes-man betwixt vs, that might lay his hand vpon vs both.
\p
\v 34 Let him take his rodde away from me, & let not his feare terrifie me:
\p
\v 35 Then would I speake, and not feare him; but it is not so with me.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 My soule is weary of my life, I will leaue my complaint vpon my selfe; I will speake in the bitternesse of my soule.
\p
\v 2 I will say vnto God, Doe not condemne mee; shewe me wherefore thou contendest with me.
\p
\v 3 Is it good vnto thee, that thou shouldest oppresse? that thou shouldest despise the worke of thine hands? and shine vpon the counsell of the wicked?
\p
\v 4 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?
\p
\v 5 Are thy dayes as the dayes of man? are thy yeeres as mans dayes,
\p
\v 6 That thou enquirest after mine iniquitie, and searchest after my sinne?
\p
\v 7 Thou knowest that I am not wicked, and there is none that can deliuer out of thine hand.
\p
\v 8 Thine hands haue made me and fashioned me together round about yet thou doest destroy me.
\p
\v 9 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay, and wilt thou bring me into dust againe?
\p
\v 10 Hast thou not powred me out as milke, and cruddled me like cheese?
\p
\v 11 Thou hast cloathed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinewes.
\p
\v 12 Thou hast granted me life and fauour, and thy visitation hath preserued my spirit.
\p
\v 13 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart; I know that this is with thee.
\p
\v 14 If I sinne, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquite me from mine iniquitie.
\p
\v 15 If I be wicked, woe vnto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift vp my head: I am full of confusion, therefore see thou mine affliction:
\p
\v 16 For it increaseth: thou huntest me as a fierce Lion: and againe thou shewest thy selfe marueilous vpon me.
\p
\v 17 Thou renuest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation vpon me; Changes and warre are against me.
\p
\v 18 Wherfore then hast thou brought me forth out of the wombe? Oh that I had giuen vp the ghost, and no eye had seene me!
\p
\v 19 I should haue bene as though I had not bene, I should haue bene caried from the wombe to the graue.
\p
\v 20 Are not my dayes few? cease then, and let me alone that I may take comfort a litle,
\p
\v 21 Before I goe whence I shall not returne, euen to the land of darknes and the shadow of death,
\p
\v 22 A land of darknes, as darknes it selfe, and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkenes.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
\p
\v 2 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should man ful of talke be iustified?
\p
\v 3 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
\p
\v 4 For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am cleane in thine eyes.
\p
\v 5 But, O that God would speake, and open his lippes against thee,
\p
\v 6 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisedome, that they are double to that which is: know therefore that God exacteth of thee lesse then thine iniquitie deserueth.
\p
\v 7 Canst thou by searching finde out God? canst thou finde out the Almightie vnto perfection?
\p
\v 8 It is as high as heauen, what canst thou doe? deeper then hell, what canst thou know?
\p
\v 9 The measure therof is longer then the earth, and broader then the sea.
\p
\v 10 If he cut off, and shut vp, or gather together, then who can hinder him?
\p
\v 11 For, he knoweth vaine men: hee seeth wickednesse also, will he not then consider it?
\p
\v 12 For vaine man would be wise; though man be borne like a wilde asses coult.
\p
\v 13 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him:
\p
\v 14 If iniquitie be in thine hand, put it farre away, and let not wickednes dwell in thy tabernacles.
\p
\v 15 For then shalt thou lift vp thy face without spot, yea thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not feare:
\p
\v 16 Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that passe away:
\p
\v 17 And thine age shalbe clearer then the noone day; thou shalt shine foorth, thou shalt be as the morning.
\p
\v 18 And thou shalt be secure because there is hope, yea thou shalt digge about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.
\p
\v 19 Also thou shalt lye downe, and none shall make thee afraid; yea many shall make suite vnto thee.
\p
\v 20 But the eyes of the wicked shall faile, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giuing vp of the ghost.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 And Iob answered, and sayd,
\p
\v 2 No doubt but ye are the people, and wisedome shall die with you.
\p
\v 3 But I haue vnderstanding as well as you, I am not inferiour to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
\p
\v 4 I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth vpon God, and he answereth him: the iust vpright man is laughed to scorne.
\p
\v 5 He that is ready to slippe with his feet, is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
\p
\v 6 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that prouoke God are secure, into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.
\p
\v 7 But aske now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the foules of the aire, and they shall tell thee.
\p
\v 8 Or speake to the earth, and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare vnto thee.
\p
\v 9 Who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this?
\p
\v 10 In whose hand is the soule of euery liuing thing, and the breath of all mankinde.
\p
\v 11 Doeth not the eare trie wordes? and the mouth taste his meate?
\p
\v 12 With the ancient is wisedome, and in length of dayes, vnderstanding.
\p
\v 13 With him is wisedome & strength, he hath counsell and vnderstanding.
\p
\v 14 Behold, he breaketh downe, and it cannot be built againe: hee shutteth vp a man, and there can be no opening.
\p
\v 15 Behold, hee withholdeth the waters, and they drie vp: also hee sendeth them out, and they ouerturne the earth.
\p
\v 16 With him is strength & wisedome: the deceiued, and the deceiuer, are his.
\p
\v 17 He leadeth counsellers away spoiled, and maketh the Iudges fooles.
\p
\v 18 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loines with a girdle.
\p
\v 19 He leadeth Princes away spoiled, and ouerthroweth the mightie.
\p
\v 20 He remooueth away the speech of the trustie, and taketh away the vnderstanding of the aged.
\p
\v 21 He powreth contempt vpon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mightie.
\p
\v 22 Hee discouereth deepe things out of darkenesse, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
\p
\v 23 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: hee inlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them againe.
\p
\v 24 He taketh away the heart of the chiefe of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wildernes where there is no way.
\p
\v 25 They grope in the darke without light, and hee maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 Loe, mine eye hath seene all this, mine eare hath heard and vnderstood it.
\p
\v 2 What yee know, the same doe I know also, I am not inferiour vnto you.
\p
\v 3 Surely I would speake to the Almighty, & I desire to reason with God.
\p
\v 4 But ye are forgers of lies, yee are all Physicians of no value.
\p
\v 5 O that you would altogether hold your peace, & it should be your wisdome.
\p
\v 6 Heare now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
\p
\v 7 Wil you speake wickedly for God? and talke deceitfully for him?
\p
\v 8 Will ye accept his person? Will yee contend for God?
\p
\v 9 Is it good that hee should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, doe ye so mocke him?
\p
\v 10 He will surely reprooue you, if yee doe secretly accept persons.
\p
\v 11 Shall not his excellencie make you afraid? and his dread fall vpon you?
\p
\v 12 Your remembrances are like vnto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
\p
\v 13 Hold your peace, let me alone that I may speake, and let come on me what will.
\p
\v 14 Wherefore doe I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?
\p
\v 15 Though hee slay mee, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintaine mine owne wayes before him.
\p
\v 16 Hee also shall be my saluation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
\p
\v 17 Heare diligently my speach, and my declaration with your eares.
\p
\v 18 Behold now, I haue ordered my cause, I know that I shall be iustified.
\p
\v 19 Who is hee that will plead with me? for now if I hold my tongue, I shall giue vp the ghost.
\p
\v 20 Only doe not two things vnto me: then will I not hide my selfe from thee.
\p
\v 21 Withdrawe thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make mee afraid.
\p
\v 22 Then call thou, and I will answere: or let me speake, and answere thou mee.
\p
\v 23 How many are mine iniquities and sinnes? make mee to knowe my transgression, and my sinne.
\p
\v 24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemie?
\p
\v 25 Wilt thou breake a leafe driuen to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the drie stubble?
\p
\v 26 For thou writest bitter things against mee, and makest me to possesse the iniquities of my youth.
\p
\v 27 Thou puttest my feete also in the stockes, and lookest narrowly vnto all my pathes; thou settest a print vpon the heeles of my feete.
\p
\v 28 And hee, as a rotten thing consumeth, as a garment that is moth-eaten.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 Man that is borne of a woman, is of few dayes, and full of trouble.
\p
\v 2 Hee commeth forth like a flower, and is cut downe: he fleeth also, as a shaddow and continueth not.
\p
\v 3 And doest thou open thine eies vpon such an one, and bringest me into iudgment with thee?
\p
\v 4 Who can bring a cleane thing out of an vncleane? not one.
\p
\v 5 Seeing his daies are determined, the number of his moneths are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot passe.
\p
\v 6 Turne from him that hee may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hircling, his day.
\p
\v 7 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut downe, that it will sprout againe, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
\p
\v 8 Though the roote thereof waxe old in the earth, and the stocke thereof die in the ground:
\p
\v 9 Yet through the sent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughes like a plant.
\p
\v 10 But man dyeth, and wasteth away; yea, man giueth vp the ghost, and where is hee?
\p
\v 11 As the waters faile from the sea, and the floud decayeth and dryeth vp:
\p
\v 12 So man lyeth downe, and riseth not, till the heauens be no more, they shall not awake; nor bee raised out of their sleepe.
\p
\v 13 O that thou wouldest hide mee in the graue, that thou wouldest keepe me secret, vntill thy wrath bee past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me.
\p
\v 14 If a man die, shall he liue againe? All the dayes of my appointed time will I waite, till my change come.
\p
\v 15 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt haue a desire to the worke of thine hands.
\p
\v 16 For nowe thou numbrest my steppes, doest thou not watch ouer my sinne?
\p
\v 17 My transgression is sealed vp in a bagge, and thou sowest vp mine iniquitie.
\p
\v 18 And surely the mountaine falling commeth to nought: and the rocke is remoued out of his place.
\p
\v 19 The waters weare the stones, thou washest away the things which growe out of the dust of the earth, and thou destroyest the hope of man.
\p
\v 20 Thou preuailest for euer against him, and hee passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
\p
\v 21 His sonnes come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought lowe, but he perceiueth it not of them.
\p
\v 22 But his flesh vpon him shall haue paine, and his soule within him shall mourne.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
\p
\v 2 Should a wise man vtter vaine knowledge, and fill his belly with the East winde?
\p
\v 3 Should hee reason with vnprofitable talke? or with speeches wherewith he can doe no good?
\p
\v 4 Yea thou castest off feare, and restrainest prayer before God.
\p
\v 5 For thy mouth vttereth thine iniquitie, and thou choosest the tongue of the craftie.
\p
\v 6 Thine owne mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea thine owne lippes testifie against thee.
\p
\v 7 Art thou the first man that was borne? or wast thou made before the hilles?
\p
\v 8 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and doest thou restraine wisedome to thy selfe?
\p
\v 9 What knowest thou that we know not? what vnderstandest thou, which is not in vs?
\p
\v 10 With vs are both the gray headed, and very aged men, much elder then thy father.
\p
\v 11 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?
\p
\v 12 Why doeth thine heart carie thee away? and what doe thine eyes winke at,
\p
\v 13 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words goe out of thy mouth?
\p
\v 14 What is man, that he should be cleane? and he which is borne of a woman, that he should be righteous?
\p
\v 15 Beholde, he putteth no trust in his Saints, yea, the heauens are not cleane in his sight.
\p
\v 16 How much more abominable and filthie is man, which drinketh iniquitie like water?
\p
\v 17 I will shew thee, heare me, and that which I haue seene, I wil declare,
\p
\v 18 Which wise men haue tolde from their fathers, and haue not hid it:
\p
\v 19 Unto whom alone the earth was giuen, and no stranger passed among them.
\p
\v 20 The wicked man trauaileth with paine all his dayes, and the number of yeeres is hidden to the oppressour.
\p
\v 21 A dreadfull sound is in his eares; in prosperitie the destroyer shall come vpon him.
\p
\v 22 He beleeueth not that he shall returne out of darkenesse, and he is waited for, of the sword.
\p
\v 23 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkenes is ready at his hand.
\p
\v 24 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall preuaile against him, as a king ready to the battell.
\p
\v 25 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himselfe against the Almightie.
\p
\v 26 He runneth vpon him, euen on his necke, vpon the thicke bosses of his bucklers:
\p
\v 27 Because he couereth his face with his fatnesse, and maketh collops of fat on his flankes.
\p
\v 28 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heapes.
\p
\v 29 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof vpon the earth.
\p
\v 30 He shall not depart out of darkenesse, the flame shall drie vp his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he goe away.
\p
\v 31 Let not him that is deceiued, trust in vanitie: for vanitie shalbe his recompence.
\p
\v 32 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not bee greene.
\p
\v 33 He shal shake off his vnripe grape as the Uine, and shall cast off his flowre as the Oliue.
\p
\v 34 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of briberie.
\p
\v 35 They conceiue mischiefe, and bring forth vanitie, and their belly prepareth deceit.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 Then Iob answered, and said,
\p
\v 2 I haue heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.
\p
\v 3 Shall vaine words haue an ende? or what emboldeneth thee, that thou answerest?
\p
\v 4 I also could speake as yee doe: if your soule were in my soules stead, I could heape vp words against you, and shake mine head at you.
\p
\v 5 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the mouing of my lips should asswage your griefe.
\p
\v 6 Though I speake, my griefe is not asswaged: and though I forbeare; what am I eased?
\p
\v 7 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate al my companie.
\p
\v 8 And thou hast filled mee with wrinckles, which is a witnesse against me: and my leannesse rising vp in me, beareth witnesse to my face.
\p
\v 9 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth vpon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes vpon me.
\p
\v 10 They haue gaped vpon me with their mouth, they haue smitten me vpon the cheeke reprochfully, they haue gathered themselues together against mee.
\p
\v 11 God hath deliuered me to the vngodly, and turned me ouer into the hands of the wicked.
\p
\v 12 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my necke, and shaken me to pieces, and set me vp for his marke.
\p
\v 13 His archers compasse me round about, he cleaueth my reines asunder, and doeth not spare; he powreth out my gall vpon the ground.
\p
\v 14 He breaketh me with breach vpon breach, he runneth vpon me like a giant.
\p
\v 15 I haue sowed sackcloth vpon my skin, and defiled my horne in the dust.
\p
\v 16 My face is fowle with weeping, and on mine eye-lids is the shadow of death;
\p
\v 17 Not for any iniustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.
\p
\v 18 O earth couer not thou my blood, and let my cry haue no place.
\p
\v 19 Also now, behold my witnesse is in heauen, and my record is on high.
\p
\v 20 My friends scorne me: but mine eye powreth out teares vnto God.
\p
\v 21 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour.
\p
\v 22 When a few yeeres are come, then I shall goe the way whence I shall not returne.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 My breath is corrupt, my dayes are extinct, the graues are ready for me.
\p
\v 2 Are there not mockers with mee? and doeth not mine eye continue in their prouocation?
\p
\v 3 Lay downe now, put me in a suretie with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?
\p
\v 4 For thou hast hid their heart from vnderstanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
\p
\v 5 Hee that speaketh flattery to his friends, euen the eyes of his children shall faile.
\p
\v 6 He hath made me also a by-word of the people, and afore time I was as a tabret.
\p
\v 7 Mine eye also is dimme by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.
\p
\v 8 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stirre vp himselfe against the hypocrite.
\p
\v 9 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath cleane hands shalbe stronger, and stronger.
\p
\v 10 But as for you all, doe you returne, and come now, for I cannot find one wise man among you.
\p
\v 11 My dayes are past, my purposes are broken off, euen the thoughts of my heart:
\p
\v 12 They change the night into day: the light is short, because of darknes.
\p
\v 13 If I waite, the graue is mine house: I haue made my bedde in the darknesse.
\p
\v 14 I haue said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worme, Thou art my mother, and my sister.
\p
\v 15 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
\p
\v 16 They shall goe downe to the barres of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite and said,
\p
\v 2 How long will it bee, ere you make an ende of words? Marke, and afterwards we will speake.
\p
\v 3 Wherefore are wee counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?
\p
\v 4 He teareth himselfe in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rocke bee remooued out of his place?
\p
\v 5 Yea, the light of the wicked shalbe put out, and the sparke of his fire shall not shine.
\p
\v 6 The light shalbe darke in his tabernacle, and his candle shalbe put out with him.
\p
\v 7 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his owne counsell shall cast him downe.
\p
\v 8 For hee is cast into a net by his owne feete, & he walketh vpon a snare.
\p
\v 9 The grinne shall take him by the heele, and the robber shall preuaile against him.
\p
\v 10 The snare is laide for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.
\p
\v 11 Terrours shall make him afraid on euery side, and shall driue him to his feete.
\p
\v 12 His strength shalbe hunger-bitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.
\p
\v 13 It shall deuoure the strength of his skinne: euen the first borne of death shall deuoure his strength.
\p
\v 14 His confidence shalbe rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrours.
\p
\v 15 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered vpon his habitation.
\p
\v 16 His rootes shall be dryed vp beneath: and aboue shall his branch be cut off.
\p
\v 17 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and hee shall haue no name in the streete.
\p
\v 18 He shall be driuen from light into darkenesse, and chased out of the world.
\p
\v 19 Hee shall neither haue sonne nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.
\p
\v 20 They that come after him shalbe astonied at his day, as they that went before, were affrighted.
\p
\v 21 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 Then Iob answered, and sayd,
\p
\v 2 How long will yee vexe my soule, and breake me in pieces with words?
\p
\v 3 These tenne times haue ye reproched me: you are not ashamed that you make your selues strange to me.
\p
\v 4 And be it indeed that I haue erred, mine errour remaineth with my selfe.
\p
\v 5 If indeed yee will magnifie your selues against me, and plead against me my reproch:
\p
\v 6 Know now that God hath ouerthrowen me, and hath compassed me with his net.
\p
\v 7 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloude, but there is no iudgement.
\p
\v 8 Hee hath fenced vp my way that I cannot passe; and hee hath set darkenesse in my pathes.
\p
\v 9 Hee hath stript me of my glory, and taken the crowne from my head.
\p
\v 10 He hath destroyed me on euery side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he remooued like a tree.
\p
\v 11 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and hee counteth me vnto him as one of his enemies.
\p
\v 12 His troupes come together, and raise vp their way against me, and encampe round about my tabernacle.
\p
\v 13 Hee hath put my brethren farre from me, and mine acquaintance are verely estranged from me.
\p
\v 14 My kinsefolke haue failed, and my familiar friends haue forgotten me.
\p
\v 15 They that dwell in mine house, and my maides count me for a stranger: I am an aliant in their sight.
\p
\v 16 I called my seruant, and he gaue me no answere: I intreated him with my mouth.
\p
\v 17 My breath is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the childrens sake of mine owne body.
\p
\v 18 Yea, yong children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.
\p
\v 19 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loued, are turned against me.
\p
\v 20 My bone cleaueth to my skinne, and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skinne of my teeth.
\p
\v 21 Haue pity vpon me, haue pitie vpon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.
\p
\v 22 Why doe ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
\p
\v 23 Oh that my wordes were now written, oh that they were printed in a booke!
\p
\v 24 That they were grauen with an iron pen and lead, in the rocke for euer.
\p
\v 25 For I know that my Redeemer liueth, and that he shall stand at the latter day, vpon the earth:
\p
\v 26 And though after my skin, wormes destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:
\p
\v 27 Whom I shal see for my selfe, and mine eyes shall beholde, and not another, though my reines bee consumed within me.
\p
\v 28 But ye should say, Why persecute we him? seeing the root of the matter is found in me.
\p
\v 29 Bee ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that yee may know there is a iudgement.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and saide,
\p
\v 2 Therefore doe my thoughts cause mee to answere, and for this I make haste.
\p
\v 3 I haue heard the checke of my reproach, and the spirit of my vnderstanding causeth me to answere.
\p
\v 4 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed vpon earth,
\p
\v 5 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the ioy of the hypocrite but for a moment?
\p
\v 6 Though his excellencie mount vp to the heauens, and his head reach vnto the clouds:
\p
\v 7 Yet he shall perish for euer, like his owne doung: they which haue seene him, shall say, Where is he?
\p
\v 8 He shall flie away as a dreame, and shall not be found: yea he shalbe chased away as a vision of the night.
\p
\v 9 The eye also which saw him, shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
\p
\v 10 His children shall seeke to please the poore, and his hands shall restore their goods.
\p
\v 11 His bones are ful of the sinne of his youth, which shall ye downe with him in the dust.
\p
\v 12 Though wickednes be sweet in his mouth, though hee hide it vnder his tongue;
\p
\v 13 Though he spare it, and forsake it not, but keepe it stil within his mouth:
\p
\v 14 Yet his meate in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of Aspes within him.
\p
\v 15 He hath swallowed downe riches, and hee shall vomite them vp againe: God shall cast them out of his belly.
\p
\v 16 He shall sucke the poison of Aspes: the vipers tongue shall slay him.
\p
\v 17 Hee shall not see the riuers, the floods, the brookes of hony and butter.
\p
\v 18 That which he laboured for, shall he restore, & shall not swallow it downe: according to his substance shall the restitution bee, and hee shall not reioyce therein.
\p
\v 19 Because hee hath oppressed, and hath forsaken the poore; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not:
\p
\v 20 Surely he shall not feele quietnesse in his belly, hee shall not saue of that which he desired.
\p
\v 21 There shall none of his meat be left, therefore shall no man looke for his goods.
\p
\v 22 In the fulnesse of his sufficiencie, he shalbe in straites: euery hand of the wicked shall come vpon him.
\p
\v 23 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the furie of his wrath vpon him, and shall raine it vpon him while he is eating.
\p
\v 24 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steele shall strike him through.
\p
\v 25 It is drawen, and commeth out of the body; yea the glistering sword commeth out of his gall; terrours are vpon him.
\p
\v 26 All darknesse shalbe hid in his secret places: a fire not blowen shall consume him; it shall goe ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
\p
\v 27 The heauen shall reueale his iniquitie: and the earth shall rise vp against him.
\p
\v 28 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
\p
\v 29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed vnto him by God.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 But Iob answered, and sayd,
\p
\v 2 Heare diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.
\p
\v 3 Suffer me that I may speake, and after that I haue spoken, mocke on.
\p
\v 4 As for mee, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?
\p
\v 5 Marke mee, and be astonished, and lay your hand vpon your mouth.
\p
\v 6 Euen when I remember, I am afraid, and trembling taketh holde on my flesh.
\p
\v 7 Wherefore doe the wicked liue, become old, yea, are mightie in power?
\p
\v 8 Their seede is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
\p
\v 9 Their houses are safe from feare, neither is the rod of God vpon them.
\p
\v 10 Their bull gendreth and faileth not, their cow calueth, and casteth not her calfe.
\p
\v 11 They send foorth their little ones like a flocke, and their children dance.
\p
\v 12 They take the timbrell and harpe, and reioyce at the sound of the organe.
\p
\v 13 They spend their daies in wealth, and in a moment goe downe to the graue.
\p
\v 14 Therefore they say vnto God, Depart from vs: for we desire not the knowledge of thy wayes.
\p
\v 15 What is the Almightie, that wee should serue him? and what profite should we haue, if we pray vnto him?
\p
\v 16 Loe, their good is not in their hand, the counsell of the wicked is farre from me.
\p
\v 17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out? and how oft commeth their destruction vpon them? God distributeth sorrowes in his anger.
\p
\v 18 They are as stubble before the winde, and as chaffe that the storme carieth away.
\p
\v 19 God layeth vp his iniquitie for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.
\p
\v 20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drinke of the wrath of the Almightie.
\p
\v 21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his moneths is cut off in the middest?
\p
\v 22 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he iudgeth those that are high.
\p
\v 23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
\p
\v 24 His breasts are full of milke, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
\p
\v 25 And another dieth in the bitternesse of his soule, and neuer eateth with pleasure.
\p
\v 26 They shall lie downe alike in the dust, and the wormes shall couer them.
\p
\v 27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the deuices which yee wrongfully imagine against me.
\p
\v 28 For ye say, where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?
\p
\v 29 Haue ye not asked them that goe by the way? and doe ye not know their tokens?
\p
\v 30 That the wicked is reserued to the day of destruction; they shall bee brought foorth to the day of wrath.
\p
\v 31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?
\p
\v 32 Yet shall hee be brought to the graue, & shall remaine in the tombe.
\p
\v 33 The cloudes of the valley shalbe sweete vnto him, and euery man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.
\p
\v 34 How then comfort ye me in vaine, seeing in your answeres there remaineth falshood?

\c 22
\p
\v 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, and said,
\p
\v 2 Can a man be profitable vnto God? as hee that is wise may be profitable vnto himselfe.
\p
\v 3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gaine to him, that thou makest thy waies perfite?
\p
\v 4 Will hee reproue thee for feare of thee? will he enter with thee into iudgment?
\p
\v 5 Is not thy wickednesse great? and thine iniquities infinite?
\p
\v 6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
\p
\v 7 Thou hast not giuen water to the wearie to drinke, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
\p
\v 8 But as for the mightie man, hee had the earth, and the honourable man dwelt in it.
\p
\v 9 Thou hast sent widowes away emptie, and the armes of the fatherlesse haue bene broken.
\p
\v 10 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden feare troubleth thee,
\p
\v 11 Or darkenes that thou canst not see, and abundance of waters couer thee.
\p
\v 12 Is not God in the height of heauen? and behold the height of the starres how high they are.
\p
\v 13 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he iudge through the darke cloude?
\p
\v 14 Thicke cloudes are a couering to him that he seeth not, and hee walketh in the circuit of heauen.
\p
\v 15 Hast thou marked the olde way which wicked men haue troden?
\p
\v 16 Which were cut downe out of time, whose foundation was ouerflowen with a flood.
\p
\v 17 Which said vnto God, Depart from vs, and what can the Almightie doe for them?
\p
\v 18 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsell of the wicked is farre from me.
\p
\v 19 The righteous see it, and are glad, and the innocent laugh them to scorne.
\p
\v 20 Whereas our substance is not cut downe, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
\p
\v 21 Acquaint now thy selfe with him, and be at peace: thereby good shal come vnto thee.
\p
\v 22 Receiue, I pray thee, the Lawe from his mouth, and lay vp his words in thine heart.
\p
\v 23 If thou returne to the Almightie, thou shalt be built vp, thou shalt put away iniquitie farre from thy tabernacles.
\p
\v 24 Then shalt thou lay vp golde as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brookes.
\p
\v 25 Yea the Almightie shall bee thy defence, and thou shalt haue plenty of siluer.
\p
\v 26 For then shalt thou haue thy delight in the Almightie, and shalt lift vp thy face vnto God.
\p
\v 27 Thou shalt make thy prayer vnto him, and he shall heare thee, and thou shalt pay thy vowes.
\p
\v 28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shal be established vnto thee: and the light shall shine vpon thy wayes.
\p
\v 29 When men are cast downe, then thou shalt say, There is lifting vp: and he shall saue the humble person.
\p
\v 30 He shall deliuer the Iland of the innocent: and it is deliuered by the purenesse of thine hands.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 Then Iob answered, and said,
\p
\v 2 Euen to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heauier then my groning.
\p
\v 3 O that I knewe where I might find him! that I might come euen to his seate!
\p
\v 4 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
\p
\v 5 I would know the words which he would answere me, and vnderstand what he would say vnto me.
\p
\v 6 Will he plead against me with his great power? No, but hee would put strength in me.
\p
\v 7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be deliuered for euer from my Iudge.
\p
\v 8 Behold, I goe forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I cannot perceiue him:
\p
\v 9 On the left hand where hee doeth worke, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himselfe on the right hand, that I cannot see him.
\p
\v 10 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
\p
\v 11 My foot hath held his steps, his way haue I kept, and not declined.
\p
\v 12 Neither haue I gone backe from the commaundement of his lippes, I haue esteemed the words of his mouth more then my necessary food.
\p
\v 13 But hee is in one minde, and who can turne him? and what his soule desireth, euen that he doeth.
\p
\v 14 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for mee: and many such things are with him.
\p
\v 15 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.
\p
\v 16 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
\p
\v 17 Because I was not cut off before the darknes, neither hath he couered the darknes from my face.

\c 24
\p
\v 1 Why, seeing Times are not hidden from the Almightie, doe they, that know him not, see his dayes?
\p
\v 2 Some remooue the land-markes; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.
\p
\v 3 They driue away the asse of the fatherlesse, they take the widowes oxe for a pledge.
\p
\v 4 They turne the needy out of the way: the poore of the earth hide themselues together.
\p
\v 5 Behold, as wilde asses in the desart, goe they foorth to their worke, rising betimes for a pray: the wildernes yeeldeth food for them, and for their children.
\p
\v 6 They reape euery one his corne in the fielde: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
\p
\v 7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they haue no couering in the cold.
\p
\v 8 They are wet with the showres of the mountaines, and imbrace the rocke for want of a shelter.
\p
\v 9 They plucke the fatherlesse from the brest, and take a pledge of the poore.
\p
\v 10 They cause him to go naked without clothing: and they take away the sheafe from the hungry,
\p
\v 11 Which make oyle within their walles, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.
\p
\v 12 Men groane from out of the city, and the soule of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.
\p
\v 13 They are of those that rebell against the light, they know not the wayes thereof, nor abide in the pathes thereof.
\p
\v 14 The murderer rising with the light, killeth the poore and needy, and in the night is as a thiefe.
\p
\v 15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.
\p
\v 16 In the darke they digge through houses which they had marked for themselues in the day time: they know not the light.
\p
\v 17 For the morning is to them euen as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrours of the shadow of death.
\p
\v 18 Hee is swift as the waters, their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the Uineyards.
\p
\v 19 Drought and heate consume the snow waters: so doeth the graue those which haue sinned.
\p
\v 20 The wombe shall forget him, the worme shall feed sweetly on him, hee shall be no more remembred, and wickednes shalbe broken as a tree.
\p
\v 21 He euill intreateth the barren, that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.
\p
\v 22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth vp, and no man is sure of life.
\p
\v 23 Though it be giuen him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are vpon their wayes.
\p
\v 24 They are exalted for a litle while, but are gone and brought low, they are taken out of the way as al other, and cut off as the tops of the eares of corne.
\p
\v 25 And if it be not so now, who will make mee a liar, and make my speach nothing worth?

\c 25
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said:
\p
\v 2 Dominion and feare are with him, hee maketh peace in his high places.
\p
\v 3 Is there any number of his armies? and vpon whom doeth not his light arise?
\p
\v 4 How then can man bee iustified with God? or how can he be cleane that is borne of a woman?
\p
\v 5 Behold euen to the moone, and it shineth not, yea the starres are not pure in his sight.
\p
\v 6 How much lesse man, that is a worme: and the sonne of man which is a worme?

\c 26
\p
\v 1 But Iob answered and sayd,
\p
\v 2 Howe hast thou helped him that is without power? how sauest thou the arme that hath no strength?
\p
\v 3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisedome? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing, as it is?
\p
\v 4 To whom hast thou vttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
\p
\v 5 Dead things are formed from vnder the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
\p
\v 6 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no couering.
\p
\v 7 He stretcheth out the North ouer the emptie place, and hangeth the earth vpon nothing.
\p
\v 8 Hee bindeth vp the waters in his thicke clouds, and the cloud is not rent vnder them.
\p
\v 9 Hee holdeth backe the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud vpon it.
\p
\v 10 Hee hath compassed the waters with bounds, vntill the day and night come to an end.
\p
\v 11 The pillars of heauen tremble, and are astonished at his reproofe.
\p
\v 12 Hee diuideth the sea with his power, and by his vnderstanding he smiteth through the proud.
\p
\v 13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heauens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
\p
\v 14 Loe, these are parts of his waies, but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can vnderstand?

\c 27
\p
\v 1 Moreouer Iob continued his parable, and sayd,
\p
\v 2 As God liueth, who hath taken away my iudgment, and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soule;
\p
\v 3 All the while my breath is in mee, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
\p
\v 4 My lips shall not speake wickednesse, nor my tongue vtter deceit.
\p
\v 5 God forbid that I should iustifie you: till I die, I will not remoue my integritie from me.
\p
\v 6 My righteousnesse I hold fast, and will not let it goe: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I liue.
\p
\v 7 Let mine enemie be as the wicked, and he that riseth vp against me, as the vnrighteous.
\p
\v 8 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soule?
\p
\v 9 Will God heare his cry, when trouble commeth vpon him?
\p
\v 10 Will he delight himselfe in the Almightie? will hee alwayes call vpon God?
\p
\v 11 I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almightie, will I not conceale.
\p
\v 12 Behold, all ye your selues haue seene it, why then are yee thus altogether vaine?
\p
\v 13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressours which they shall receiue of the Almightie.
\p
\v 14 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offpring shall not be satisfied with bread.
\p
\v 15 Those that remaine of him shall bee buried in death: and his widowes shall not weepe.
\p
\v 16 Though he heape vp siluer as the dust, and prepare rayment as the clay:
\p
\v 17 He may prepare it, but the iust shall put it on, and the innocent shall diuide the siluer.
\p
\v 18 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.
\p
\v 19 The rich man shall lie downe, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not:
\p
\v 20 Terrours take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
\p
\v 21 The East winde carieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storme hurleth him out of his place.
\p
\v 22 For God shall cast vpon him, and not spare: hee would faine flee out of his hand.
\p
\v 23 Men shall clap their handes at him, and shall hisse him out of his place.

\c 28
\p
\v 1 Surely there is a veine for the siluer, and a place for golde where they fine it.
\p
\v 2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brasse is molten out of the stone.
\p
\v 3 Hee setteth an ende to darkenesse, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkenesse and the shadow of death.
\p
\v 4 The floud breaketh out from the inhabitant; euen the waters forgotten of the foote: they are dried vp, they are gone away from men.
\p
\v 5 As for the earth, out of it commeth bread: and vnder it, is turned vp as it were fire.
\p
\v 6 The stones of it are the place of Saphires: and it hath dust of golde.
\p
\v 7 There is a path which no foule knoweth, and which the vulturs eye hath not seene.
\p
\v 8 The lyons whelps haue not troden it, nor the fierce lyon passed by it.
\p
\v 9 Hee putteth foorth his hand vpon the rocke; hee ouerturneth the mountaines by the rootes.
\p
\v 10 Hee cutteth out riuers among the rockes, and his eye seeth euery precious thing.
\p
\v 11 He bindeth the flouds from ouerflowing, and the thing that is hid, bringeth he foorth to light.
\p
\v 12 But where shall wisedome bee found? and where is the place of vnderstanding?
\p
\v 13 Man knoweth not the price thereof neither is it found in the land of the liuing.
\p
\v 14 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.
\p
\v 15 It cannot be gotten for golde, neither shall siluer be weighed for the price thereof.
\p
\v 16 It cannot be valued with the golde of Ophir, with the precious Onix, or the Saphire.
\p
\v 17 The golde and the chrystall cannot equall it: and the exchange of it shall not be for iewels of fine golde.
\p
\v 18 No mention shalbe made of Corall, or of Pearles: for the price of wisedome is aboue Rubies.
\p
\v 19 The Topaze of Ethiopia shall not equall it, neither shall it be valued with pure golde.
\p
\v 20 Whence then commeth wisedome? and where is the place of vnderstanding?
\p
\v 21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all liuing, and kept close from the foules of the ayre.
\p
\v 22 Destruction and death say, Wee haue heard the fame thereof with our eares.
\p
\v 23 God vnderstandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
\p
\v 24 For hee looketh to the endes of the earth, and seeth vnder the whole heauen:
\p
\v 25 To make the weight for the windes, and he weigheth the waters by measure.
\p
\v 26 When hee made a decree for the raine, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:
\p
\v 27 Then did he see it, and declare it, he prepared it, yea and searched it out.
\p
\v 28 And vnto man he said, Behold, the feare of the Lord, that is wisedome, and to depart from euill, is vnderstanding.

\c 29
\p
\v 1 Moreouer Iob continued his parable, and said,
\p
\v 2 O that I were as in moneths past, as in the dayes when God preserued me.
\p
\v 3 When his candle shined vpon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkenesse:
\p
\v 4 As I was in the dayes of my youth, when the secret of God was vpon my tabernacle:
\p
\v 5 When the Almightie was yet with me, when my children were about me:
\p
\v 6 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rocke powred me out riuers of oyle:
\p
\v 7 When I went out to the gate, through the citie, when I prepared my seate in the street.
\p
\v 8 The yong men saw me, and hid themselues: and the aged arose, and stood vp.
\p
\v 9 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.
\p
\v 10 The Nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaued to the roofe of their mouth.
\p
\v 11 When the eare heard mee, then it blessed me, and when the eye saw me, it gaue witnesse to me:
\p
\v 12 Because I deliuered the poore that cried, and the fatherlesse, and him that had none to helpe him.
\p
\v 13 The blessing of him that was readie to perish, came vpon me: and I caused the widowes heart to sing for ioy.
\p
\v 14 I put on righteousnesse, and it clothed me: my iudgement was as a robe and a diademe.
\p
\v 15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
\p
\v 16 I was a father to the poore: and the cause which I knewe not, I searched out.
\p
\v 17 And I brake the iawes of the wicked, and pluckt the spoile out of his teeth.
\p
\v 18 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiplie my dayes as the sand.
\p
\v 19 My roote was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night vpon my branch.
\p
\v 20 My glory was fresh in mee, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
\p
\v 21 Unto me men gaue eare, and waited, and kept silence at my counsell.
\p
\v 22 After my words they spake not againe, & my speach dropped vpon them,
\p
\v 23 And they waited for me as for the raine, and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter raine.
\p
\v 24 If I laughed on them, they beleeued it not, and the light of my countenance they cast not downe.
\p
\v 25 I chose out their way, and sate chiefe, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.

\c 30
\p
\v 1 But nowe they that are yonger then I, haue mee in derision, whose fathers I would haue disdained to haue set with the dogs of my flocke.
\p
\v 2 Yea whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom olde age was perished?
\p
\v 3 For want and famine they were solitarie: flying into the wildernesse in former time desolate and waste:
\p
\v 4 Who cut vp mallowes by the bushes, and Iuniper rootes for their meate.
\p
\v 5 They were driuen foorth from among men, (they cried after them, as after a thiefe.)
\p
\v 6 To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caues of the earth, and in the rockes.
\p
\v 7 Among the bushes they brayed: vnder the nettles they were gathered together.
\p
\v 8 They were children of fooles, yea children of base men: they were viler then the earth.
\p
\v 9 And now am I their song, yea I am their by-word.
\p
\v 10 They abhorre me, they flee farre from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
\p
\v 11 Because hee hath loosed my cord and afflicted me, they haue also let loose the bridle before me.
\p
\v 12 Upon my right hand rise the youth, they push away my feete, and they raise vp against mee the wayes of their destruction.
\p
\v 13 They marre my path, they set forward my calamitie, they haue no helper.
\p
\v 14 They came vpon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselues vpon me.
\p
\v 15 Terrours are turned vpon mee: they pursue my soule as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloude.
\p
\v 16 And now my soule is powred out vpon me: the dayes of affliction haue taken hold vpon me.
\p
\v 17 My bones are pierced in mee in the night season: and my sinewes take no rest.
\p
\v 18 By the great force of my disease, is my garment changed: it bindeth mee about as the collar of my coat.
\p
\v 19 He hath cast mee into the myre, and I am become like dust and ashes.
\p
\v 20 I crie vnto thee, and thou doest not heare me: I stand vp, and thou regardest me not.
\p
\v 21 Thou art become cruell to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thy selfe against me.
\p
\v 22 Thou liftest me vp to the wind: thou causest me to ride vpon it, and dissoluest my substance.
\p
\v 23 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all liuing.
\p
\v 24 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the graue, though they cry in his destruction.
\p
\v 25 Did not I weepe for him that was in trouble? was not my soule grieued for the poore?
\p
\v 26 When I looked for good, then euill came vnto mee: and when I waited for light, there came darkenes.
\p
\v 27 My bowels boyled and rested not: the dayes of affliction preuented mee.
\p
\v 28 I went mourning without the Sunne: I stood vp, and I cried in the Congregation.
\p
\v 29 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owles.
\p
\v 30 My skinne is blacke vpon mee, and my bones are burnt with heat.
\p
\v 31 My harpe also is turned to mourning, and my organe into the voyce of them that weepe.

\c 31
\p
\v 1 I made a couenant with mine eyes; why then should I thinke vpon a mayd?
\p
\v 2 For what portion of God is there from aboue? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
\p
\v 3 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquitie?
\p
\v 4 Doeth not he see my wayes, and count all my steps?
\p
\v 5 If I haue walked with vanitie, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
\p
\v 6 Let me bee weighed in an euen ballance, that God may know mine integritie.
\p
\v 7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaued to my hands:
\p
\v 8 Then let mee sow, and let another eate, yea let my off-spring be rooted out.
\p
\v 9 If mine heart haue bene deceiued by a woman, or if I haue layde wait at my neighbours doore:
\p
\v 10 Then let my wife grind vnto another, and let others bow downe vpon her.
\p
\v 11 For this is an heinous crime, yea, it is an iniquitie to bee punished by the Iudges.
\p
\v 12 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would roote out all mine encrease.
\p
\v 13 If I did despise the cause of my man-seruant, or of my mayd-seruant, when they contended with me:
\p
\v 14 What then shall I do, when God riseth vp? and when hee visiteth, what shall I answere him?
\p
\v 15 Did not hee that made mee in the wombe, make him? and did not one fashion vs in the wombe?
\p
\v 16 If I haue withhelde the poore from their desire, or haue caused the eyes of the widow to faile:
\p
\v 17 Or haue eaten my morsell my selfe alone, and the fatherlesse hath not eaten thereof:
\p
\v 18 (For from my youth hee was brought vp with me as with a father, and I haue guided her from my mothers wombe.)
\p
\v 19 If I haue seene any perish for want of cloathing, or any poore without couering:
\p
\v 20 If his loynes haue not blessed me, and if hee were not warmed with the fleece of my sheepe:
\p
\v 21 If I haue lift vp my hand against the fatherlesse, when I saw my helpe in the gate:
\p
\v 22 Then let mine arme fall from my shoulder-blade, and mine arme be broken from the bone.
\p
\v 23 For destruction from God was a terrour to mee: and by reason of his highnesse, I could not endure.
\p
\v 24 If I haue made golde my hope, or haue said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence:
\p
\v 25 If I reioyced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much:
\p
\v 26 If I beheld the Sunne when it shined, or the Moone walking in brightnesse:
\p
\v 27 And my heart hath bene secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
\p
\v 28 This also were an iniquitie to be punished by the Iudge: For I should haue denied the God that is aboue.
\p
\v 29 If I reioyced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lift vp my selfe when euill found him:
\p
\v 30 (Neither haue I suffered my mouth to sinne by wishing a curse to his soule.)
\p
\v 31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! wee cannot be satisfied.
\p
\v 32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doores to the trauailer.
\p
\v 33 If I couered my transgressions, as Adam: by hiding mine iniquitie in my bosome:
\p
\v 34 Did I feare a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrifie me: that I kept silence, and went not out of the doore?
\p
\v 35 O that one would heare me! beholde, my desire is, that the Almightie would answere me, and that mine aduersary had written a booke.
\p
\v 36 Surely I would take it vpon my shoulder, and bind it as a crowne to me.
\p
\v 37 I would declare vnto him the number of my steps, as a prince would I goe neere vnto him.
\p
\v 38 If my land cry against me, or that the furrowes likewise thereof complaine:
\p
\v 39 If I haue eaten the fruits thereof without money, or haue caused the owners thereof to loose their life:
\p
\v 40 Let thistles grow in stead of wheat, and cockle in stead of barley. The words of Iob are ended.

\c 32
\p
\v 1 So these three men ceased to answere Iob, because he was righteous in his owne eyes.
\p
\v 2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu, the sonne of Barachel the Buzite, of the kinred of Ram: against Iob was his wrath kindled, because he iustified himselfe rather then God.
\p
\v 3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled: because they had found no answere, and yet had condemned Iob.
\p
\v 4 Now Elihu had waited till Iob had spoken: because they were elder then he.
\p
\v 5 When Elihu saw that there was no answere in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
\p
\v 6 And Elihu the sonne of Barachel the Buzite answered and sayd: I am yong, and yee are very old, wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.
\p
\v 7 I said, Dayes should speake, and multitude of yeeres should teach wisedome.
\p
\v 8 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almightie giueth them vnderstanding.
\p
\v 9 Great men are not alwayes wise: neither doe the aged vnderstand iudgement.
\p
\v 10 Therfore I sayd, Hearken to me: I also will shew mine opinion.
\p
\v 11 Behold, I waited for your words: I gaue eare to your reasons, whilest you searched out what to say.
\p
\v 12 Yea, I attended vnto you: and beholde, there was none of you that conuinced Iob, or that answered his words:
\p
\v 13 Lest ye should say, We haue found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.
\p
\v 14 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answere him with your speeches.
\p
\v 15 They were amased, they answered no more, they left off speaking.
\p
\v 16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still and answered no more.)
\p
\v 17 I sayd, I will answere also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.
\p
\v 18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
\p
\v 19 Behold, my belly is as wine, which hath no vent, it is ready to burst like new bottles.
\p
\v 20 I will speake, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lippes, and answere.
\p
\v 21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any mans person: neither let me giue flattering titles vnto man.
\p
\v 22 For I know not to giue flattering titles: in so doing my maker would soone take me away.

\c 33
\p
\v 1 Wherefore, Iob, I pray thee, heare my speeches, and hearken to all my wordes.
\p
\v 2 Behold, now I haue opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
\p
\v 3 My words shalbe of the vprightnesse of my heart: and my lippes shall vtter knowledge clearely.
\p
\v 4 The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almightie hath giuen me life.
\p
\v 5 If thou canst, answere me, set thy wordes in order before me, stand vp.
\p
\v 6 Behold, I am according to thy wish in Gods stead: I also am formed out of the clay.
\p
\v 7 Behold, my terrour shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heauie vpon thee.
\p
\v 8 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I haue heard the voice of thy words, saying,
\p
\v 9 I am cleane without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquitie in me.
\p
\v 10 Behold, hee findeth occasions against mee, hee counteth mee for his enemie.
\p
\v 11 He putteth my feete in the stockes, he marketh all my pathes.
\p
\v 12 Behold, in this thou art not iust: I will answere thee, That God is greater then man.
\p
\v 13 Why doest thou striue against him? for he giueth not account of any of his matters.
\p
\v 14 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiueth it not.
\p
\v 15 In a dreame, in a vision of the night, when deepe sleepe falleth vpon men, in slumbrings vpon the bed:
\p
\v 16 Then hee openeth the eares of men, and sealeth their instruction,
\p
\v 17 That hee may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
\p
\v 18 Hee keepeth backe his soule from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
\p
\v 19 Hee is chastened also with paine vpon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong paine.
\p
\v 20 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soule daintie meate.
\p
\v 21 His flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seene; and his bones that were not seene, sticke out.
\p
\v 22 His soule draweth neere vnto the graue, and his life to the destroyers.
\p
\v 23 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew vnto man his vprightnesse:
\p
\v 24 Then hee is gracious vnto him, and sayth, Deliuer him from going downe to the pit; I haue found a ransome.
\p
\v 25 His flesh shall be fresher then a childes: he shall returne to the dayes of his youth.
\p
\v 26 He shall pray vnto God, and hee will be fauourable vnto him, and hee shall see his face with ioy: for hee will render vnto man his righteousnesse.
\p
\v 27 He looketh vpon men, and if any say, I haue sinned, and peruerted that which was right, and it profited mee not:
\p
\v 28 Hee will deliuer his soule from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
\p
\v 29 Loe, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,
\p
\v 30 To bring backe his soule from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the liuing.
\p
\v 31 Marke well, O Iob, hearken vnto me, hold thy peace, and I wil speake.
\p
\v 32 If thou hast any thing to say, answere me: speake, for I desire to iustifie thee.
\p
\v 33 If not, hearken vnto me: holde thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisedome.

\c 34
\p
\v 1 Furthermore Elihu answered, and said,
\p
\v 2 Heare my wordes, O yee wise men, and giue eare vnto me, ye that haue knowledge.
\p
\v 3 For the eare trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meate.
\p
\v 4 Let vs chuse to vs iudgement: let vs know among our selues what is good.
\p
\v 5 For Iob hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my iudgement.
\p
\v 6 Should I lye against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
\p
\v 7 What man is like Iob, who drinketh vp scorning like water?
\p
\v 8 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquitie, and walketh with wicked men.
\p
\v 9 For hee hath said, It profiteth a man nothing, that he should delight himselfe with God.
\p
\v 10 Therefore hearken vnto me, ye men of vnderstanding: farre bee it from God, that he should doe wickednes, and from the Almighty, that hee should commit iniquitie.
\p
\v 11 For the worke of a man shall he render vnto him, and cause euery man to finde according to his wayes.
\p
\v 12 Yea surely God will not doe wickedly, neither will the Almighty peruert iudgement.
\p
\v 13 Who hath giuen him a charge ouer the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
\p
\v 14 If he set his heart vpon man, if he gather vnto himselfe his spirit and his breath;
\p
\v 15 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turne againe vnto dust.
\p
\v 16 If now thou hast vnderstanding, heare this: hearken to the voyce of my words.
\p
\v 17 Shall euen he that hateth right, gouerne? and wilt thou condemne him that is most iust?
\p
\v 18 Is it fit to say to a King, Thou art wicked? and to Princes, Ye are vngodly?
\p
\v 19 How much lesse to him that accepteth not the persons of Princes, nor regardeth the rich more then the poore? for they all are the woorke of his hands.
\p
\v 20 In a moment shall they die, and the people shalbe troubled at midnight, and passe away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
\p
\v 21 For his eyes are vpon the wayes of man, and he seeth all his goings.
\p
\v 22 There is no darkenes, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquitie may hide themselues.
\p
\v 23 For hee will not lay vpon man more then right; that he should enter into iudgement with God.
\p
\v 24 He shall breake in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
\p
\v 25 Therefore hee knoweth their workes, and he ouerturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
\p
\v 26 He striketh them as wicked men, in the open sight of others:
\p
\v 27 Because they turned backe from him, and would not consider any of his wayes.
\p
\v 28 So that they cause the cry of the poore to come vnto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
\p
\v 29 When he giueth quietnesse, who then can make trouble? and when hee hideth his face, who then can beholde him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man onely:
\p
\v 30 That the hypocrite raigne not, lest the people be ensnared.
\p
\v 31 Surely it is meete to be said vnto God, I haue borne chastisement, I will not offend any more.
\p
\v 32 That which I see not, teach thou me; If I haue done iniquitie, I will doe no more.
\p
\v 33 Should it bee according to thy minde? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou chuse, and not I: therefore speake what thou knowest.
\p
\v 34 Let men of vnderstanding tell mee, and let a wise man hearken vnto mee.
\p
\v 35 Iob hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdome.
\p
\v 36 My desire is that Iob may bee tried vnto the ende, because of his answeres for wicked men.
\p
\v 37 For he addeth rebellion vnto his sinne, hee clappeth his handes amongst vs, and multiplieth his words against God.

\c 35
\p
\v 1 Elihu spake moreouer, and said,
\p
\v 2 Thinkest thou this to bee right, that thou saydest, My righteousnesse is more then Gods?
\p
\v 3 For thou saydst, what aduantage will it bee vnto thee, and, what profite shall I haue, if I bee cleansed from my sinne?
\p
\v 4 I will answere thee, and thy companions with thee.
\p
\v 5 Looke vnto the heauens and see, and behold the clouds which are higher then thou.
\p
\v 6 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or it thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou vnto him?
\p
\v 7 If thou be righteous, what giuest thou him? or what receiueth hee of thine hand?
\p
\v 8 Thy wickednesse may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righteousnesse may profit the sonne of man.
\p
\v 9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to crie: they crie out by reason of the arme of the mightie.
\p
\v 10 But none saith, where is God my maker, who giueth songs in the night?
\p
\v 11 Who teacheth vs more then the beasts of the earth, and maketh vs wiser then the foules of heauen.
\p
\v 12 There they crie, (but none giueth answere) because of the pride of euill men.
\p
\v 13 Surely God wil not heare vanitie, neither wil the Almightie regard it.
\p
\v 14 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet iudgement is before him, therefore trust thou in him.
\p
\v 15 But now because it is not so, hee hath visited in his anger, yet he knoweth it not in great extremitie:
\p
\v 16 Therefore doeth Iob open his mouth in vaine: he multiplieth words without knowledge.

\c 36
\p
\v 1 Elihu also proceeded, and said,
\p
\v 2 Suffer mee a little, and I will shewe thee, that I haue yet to speake on Gods behalfe.
\p
\v 3 I will fetch my knowledge from afarre, and will ascribe righteousnesse to my Maker.
\p
\v 4 For truely my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge, is with thee.
\p
\v 5 Behold, God is mightie, and despiseth not any: he is mightie in strength and wisedome.
\p
\v 6 He preserueth not the life of the wicked: but giueth right to the poore.
\p
\v 7 Hee withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne, yea he doth establish them for euer, and they are exalted.
\p
\v 8 And if they bee bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction:
\p
\v 9 Then hee sheweth them their worke, and their transgressions, that they haue exceeded.
\p
\v 10 He openeth also their eare to discipline, and commandeth that they returne from iniquitie.
\p
\v 11 If they obey and serue him, they shall spend their dayes in prosperitie, and their yeeres in pleasures.
\p
\v 12 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
\p
\v 13 But the hypocrites in heart heape vp wrath: they crie not when he bindeth them.
\p
\v 14 They die in youth, and their life is among the vncleane.
\p
\v 15 He deliuereth the poore in his affliction, and openeth their eares in oppression.
\p
\v 16 Euen so would he haue remooued thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitnesse, and that which should be set on thy table, should be full of fatnesse.
\p
\v 17 But thou hast fulfilled the iudgement of the wicked: iudgement and iustice take hold on thee.
\p
\v 18 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransome cannot deliuer thee.
\p
\v 19 Will he esteeme thy riches? no not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
\p
\v 20 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
\p
\v 21 Take heed, regard not iniquitie: for this hast thou chosen rather then affliction.
\p
\v 22 Beholde, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
\p
\v 23 Who hath inioyned him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquitie?
\p
\v 24 Remember that thou magnifie his worke, which men behold.
\p
\v 25 Euery man may see it, man may behold it afarre off.
\p
\v 26 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his yeeres be searched out.
\p
\v 27 For hee maketh small the drops of water: they powre downe raine according to the vapour thereof:
\p
\v 28 Which the clouds doe drop, and distill vpon man aboundantly.
\p
\v 29 Also can any vnderstand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?
\p
\v 30 Behold, he spreadeth his light vpon it, and couereth the bottome of the sea.
\p
\v 31 For by them iudgeth he the people, he giueth meate in abundance.
\p
\v 32 With clouds he couereth the light, and commaundeth it not to shine, by the cloud that commeth betwixt.
\p
\v 33 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattel also concerning the Uapour.

\c 37
\p
\v 1 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moued out of his place.
\p
\v 2 Heare attentiuely the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
\p
\v 3 Hee directeth it vnder the whole heauen, and his lightning vnto the ends of the earth.
\p
\v 4 After it a voyce roareth: he thundreth with the voice of his excellencie, and hee will not stay them when his voice is heard.
\p
\v 5 God thundereth maruellously with his voice: great things doth hee, which we cannot comprehend.
\p
\v 6 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth: likewise to the small raine, and to the great raine of his strength.
\p
\v 7 He sealeth vp the hand of euery man; that all men may knowe his worke.
\p
\v 8 Then the beastes goe into dennes: and remaine in their places.
\p
\v 9 Out of the South commeth the whirlewinde: and cold out of the North.
\p
\v 10 By the breath of God, frost is giuen: and the breadth of the waters is straitned.
\p
\v 11 Also by watring he wearieth the thicke cloud: hee scattereth his bright cloud.
\p
\v 12 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may doe whatsoeuer hee commaundeth them vpon the face of the world in the earth.
\p
\v 13 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
\p
\v 14 Hearken vnto this, O Iob: stand still, and consider the wondrous workes of God.
\p
\v 15 Doest thou knowe when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
\p
\v 16 Doest thou know the ballancings of the clouds, the wondrous workes of him which is perfect in knowledge?
\p
\v 17 How thy garments are warme, when hee quieteth the earth by the South wind?
\p
\v 18 Hast thou with him spread out the skie, which is strong, and as a molten looking glasse?
\p
\v 19 Teach vs what we shall say vnto him; for we cannot order our speach by reason of darknes.
\p
\v 20 Shall it bee told him that I speake? if a man speake, surely he shalbe swallowed vp.
\p
\v 21 And nowe men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth and cleanseth them.
\p
\v 22 Faire weather commeth out of the North: with God is terrible maiestie.
\p
\v 23 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in iudgement, and in plenty of iustice: he will not afflict.
\p
\v 24 Men doe therefore feare him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.

\c 38
\p
\v 1 Then the Lord answered Iob out of the whirlewind, and sayd,
\p
\v 2 Who is this that darkneth counsell by words without knowledge?
\p
\v 3 Gird vp nowe thy loines like a man; for I will demaund of thee, and answere thou me.
\p
\v 4 Where wast thou when I layd the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast vnderstanding.
\p
\v 5 Who hath layd the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line vpon it?
\p
\v 6 Wherepuon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who layd the corner stone thereof?
\p
\v 7 When the morning starres sang together, and all the sonnes of God shouted for ioy.
\p
\v 8 Or who shut vp the sea with doores, when it brake foorth as if it had issued out of the wombe?
\p
\v 9 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thicke darknesse a swadling band for it,
\p
\v 10 And brake vp for it my decreed place, and set barres and doores,
\p
\v 11 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and heere shall thy proud waues be stayed.
\p
\v 12 Hast thou commaunded the morning since thy daies? and caused the day-spring to know his place,
\p
\v 13 That it might take hold of the endes of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
\p
\v 14 It is turned as clay to the seale, and they stand as a garment.
\p
\v 15 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arme shalbe broken.
\p
\v 16 Hast thou entred into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
\p
\v 17 Haue the gates of death bene opened vnto thee? or hast thou seene the doores of the shadow of death?
\p
\v 18 Hast thou perceiued the breadth of the earth? Declare if thou knowest it all.
\p
\v 19 Where is the way where light dwelleth? And as for darknesse, where is the place thereof?
\p
\v 20 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the pathes to the house thereof.
\p
\v 21 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then borne? or because the number of thy daies is great?
\p
\v 22 Hast thou entred into the treasures of the snowe? or hast thou seene the treasures of the haile,
\p
\v 23 Which I haue reserued against the time of trouble, against the day of battaile and warre?
\p
\v 24 By what way is the light parted? which scattereth the East wind vpon the earth.
\p
\v 25 Who hath diuided a water-course for the ouerflowing of waters? or a way for the lightning of thunder,
\p
\v 26 To cause it to raine on the earth, where no man is: on the wildernesse wherein there is no man?
\p
\v 27 To satisfie the desolate and waste ground, and to cause the bud of the tender herbe to spring forth.
\p
\v 28 Hath the raine a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
\p
\v 29 Out of whose wombe came the yce? and the hoary frost of heauen, who hath gendred it?
\p
\v 30 The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deepe is frozen.
\p
\v 31 Canst thou bind the sweete influences of Pleiades? or loose the bands of Orion?
\p
\v 32 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season, or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sonnes?
\p
\v 33 Knowest thou the ordinances of heauen? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
\p
\v 34 Canst thou lift vp thy voice to the cloudes, that abundance of waters may couer thee?
\p
\v 35 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may goe, and say vnto thee, Here we are?
\p
\v 36 Who hath put wisedome in the inward parts? or who hath giuen vnderstanding to the heart?
\p
\v 37 Who can number the cloudes in wisedome? or who can stay the bottles of heauen,
\p
\v 38 When the dust groweeh into hardnesse, and the clods cleaue fast together?
\p
\v 39 Wilt thou hunt the pray for the lyon? or fill the appetite of the young lyons,
\p
\v 40 When they couch in their dennes, and abide in the couert to lie in waite?
\p
\v 41 Who prouideth for the rauen his foode? when his young ones cry vnto God, they wander for lacke of meate.

\c 39
\p
\v 1 Knowest thou the time when the wild goates of the rocke bring forth? or canst thou marke when the hindes doe calue?
\p
\v 2 Canst thou number the moneths that they fulfill? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
\p
\v 3 They bowe themselues, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrowes.
\p
\v 4 Their yong ones are in good liking, they grow vp with corne: they go forth, and returne not vnto them.
\p
\v 5 Who hath sent out the wild asse free? or who hath looosed the bands of the wild asse?
\p
\v 6 Whose house I haue made the wildernesse, and the barren lande his dwellings.
\p
\v 7 He scorneth the multitude of the citie, neither regardeth he the crying of the driuer.
\p
\v 8 The range of the mountaines is his pasture, and hee searcheth after euery greene thing.
\p
\v 9 Will the Unicorne be willing to serue thee? or abide by thy cribbe?
\p
\v 10 Canst thou binde the Unicorne with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleyes after thee?
\p
\v 11 Wilt thou trust him because his strength is great? or wilt thou leaue thy labour to him?
\p
\v 12 Wilt thou beleeue him that hee will bring home thy seed? and gather it into thy barne?
\p
\v 13 Gauest thou the goodly wings vnto the peacocks, or wings and feathers vnto the Ostrich?
\p
\v 14 Which leaueth her egges in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,
\p
\v 15 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wilde beast may breake them.
\p
\v 16 She is hardened against her yong ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vaine without feare.
\p
\v 17 Because God hath depriued her of wisedome, neither hath he imparted to her vnderstanding.
\p
\v 18 What time she lifteth vp her selfe on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.
\p
\v 19 Hast thou giuen the horse strength? hast thou clothed his necke with thunder?
\p
\v 20 Canst thou make him afraid as a grashopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.
\p
\v 21 He paweth in the valley, and reioyceth in his strength: hee goeth on to meet the armed men.
\p
\v 22 He mocketh at feare, and is not affrighted: neither turneth he backe from the sword.
\p
\v 23 The quiuer ratleth against him, the glittering speare and the shield.
\p
\v 24 He swalloweth the ground with fiercenesse and rage: neither beleeueth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
\p
\v 25 Hee saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha: and he smelleth the battaile afarre off, the thunder of the captaines, and the shouting.
\p
\v 26 Doeth the hawke flie by thy wisedome, and stretch her wings toward the South?
\p
\v 27 Doeth the Eagle mount vp at thy commaund? and make her nest on high?
\p
\v 28 She dwelleth and abideth on the rocke, vpon the cragge of the rocke, and the strong place.
\p
\v 29 From thence she seeketh the pray, and her eyes behold a farre off.
\p
\v 30 Her yong ones also suck vp blood: and where the slaine are, there is he.

\c 40
\p
\v 1 Moreouer the Lord answered Iob, and said,
\p
\v 2 Shall hee that contendeth with the Almightie, instruct him? he that reproueth God, let him answere it.
\p
\v 3 ¶ Then Iob answered the Lord, and said,
\p
\v 4 Behold, I am vile, what shall I answere thee? I wil lay my hand vpon my mouth.
\p
\v 5 Once haue I spoken, but I will not answere: yea twise, but I will proceed no further.
\p
\v 6 ¶ Then answered the Lord vnto Iob out of the whirlewinde, and said:
\p
\v 7 Gird vp thy loynes now like a man: I will demaund of thee, and declare thou vnto me.
\p
\v 8 Wilt thou also disanul my iudgement? Wilt thou condemne mee, that thou mayest be righteous?
\p
\v 9 Hast thou an arme like God? or canst thou thunder with a voyce like him?
\p
\v 10 Decke thy selfe now with Maiestie, and excellencie, and aray thy selfe with glory, and beautie.
\p
\v 11 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold euery one that is proud, and abase him.
\p
\v 12 Looke on euery one that is proud, and bring him low: and tread downe the wicked in their place.
\p
\v 13 Hide them in the dust together, and binde their faces in secret.
\p
\v 14 Then will I also confesse vnto thee, that thine owne right hand can saue thee.
\p
\v 15 ¶ Beholde now Behemoth which I made with thee, hee eateth grasse as an oxe.
\p
\v 16 Loe now, his strength is in his loynes, and his force is in the nauell of his belly.
\p
\v 17 Hee moueth his taile like a Cedar: the sinewes of his stones are wrapt together.
\p
\v 18 His bones are as strong pieces of brasse: his bones are like barres of iron.
\p
\v 19 Hee is the chiefe of the wayes of God: he that made him, can make his sword to approach vnto him.
\p
\v 20 Surely the mountaines bring him foorth foode: where all the beasts of the field play.
\p
\v 21 He lieth vnder the shady trees in the couert of the reede, and fennes.
\p
\v 22 The shady trees couer him with their shaddow: the willowes of the brooke compasse him about.
\p
\v 23 Behold, he drinketh vp a riuer, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw vp Iordan into his mouth.
\p
\v 24 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pearceth through snares.

\c 41
\p
\v 1 Canst thou draw out Leuiathan with an hooke? or his tongue with a corde which thou lettest downe?
\p
\v 2 Canst thou put an hooke into his nose? or bore his iawe through with a thorne?
\p
\v 3 Will he make many supplications vnto thee? will he speake soft words vnto thee?
\p
\v 4 Will he make a couenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a seruant for euer?
\p
\v 5 Wilt thou play with him as with a birde? wilt thou binde him for thy maydens?
\p
\v 6 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?
\p
\v 7 Canst thou fill his skinne with barbed irons? or his head with fishspeares?
\p
\v 8 Lay thine hand vpon him, remember the battell: doe no more.
\p
\v 9 Behold, the hope of him is in vaine: shall not one be cast downe euen at the sight of him?
\p
\v 10 None is so fierce that dare stirre him vp: who then is able to stand before me?
\p
\v 11 Who hath preuented me that I should repay him? whatsoeuer is vnder the whole heauen, is mine.
\p
\v 12 I will not conceale his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
\p
\v 13 Who can discouer the face of his garment? or who can come to him, with his double bridle?
\p
\v 14 Who can open the doores of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.
\p
\v 15 His scales are his pride, shut vp together as with a close seale.
\p
\v 16 One is so neere to another, that no ayre can come betweene them.
\p
\v 17 They are ioyned one to another, they sticke together, that they cannot be sundred.
\p
\v 18 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eye-liddes of the morning.
\p
\v 19 Out of his mouth goe burning lampes, and sparkes of fire leape out.
\p
\v 20 Out of his nostrels goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
\p
\v 21 His breath kindleth coales, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
\p
\v 22 In his necke remaineth strength, and sorrowe is turned into ioy before him.
\p
\v 23 The flakes of his flesh are ioyned together: they are firme in themselues, they cannot be moued.
\p
\v 24 His heart is as firme as a stone, yea as hard as a peece of the nether mil-stone.
\p
\v 25 When he rayseth vp himselfe, the mightie are afraid: by reason of breakings they purifie themselues.
\p
\v 26 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the speare, the dart, nor the habergeon.
\p
\v 27 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brasse as rotten wood.
\p
\v 28 The arrow cannot make him flee: sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.
\p
\v 29 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a speare.
\p
\v 30 Sharpe stones are vnder him: he spreadeth sharpe pointed things vpon the mire.
\p
\v 31 He maketh the deepe to boyle like a pot: hee maketh the sea like a pot of oyntment.
\p
\v 32 Hee maketh a path to shine after him; one would thinke the deepe to bee hoarie.
\p
\v 33 Upon earth there is not his like: who is made without feare.
\p
\v 34 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king ouer all the children of pride.

\c 42
\p
\v 1 Then Iob answered the Lord, and said,
\p
\v 2 I know that thou canst doe euery thing, and that no thought can bee withholden from thee.
\p
\v 3 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore haue I vttered that I vnderstood not, things too wonderfull for me, which I knew not.
\p
\v 4 Heare, I beseech thee, and I will speake: I will demand of thee, and declare thou vnto me.
\p
\v 5 I haue heard of thee by the hearing of the eare: but now mine eye seeth thee.
\p
\v 6 Wherefore I abhorre my selfe, and repent in dust and ashes.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And it was so, that after the Lord had spoken these words vnto Iob, the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, & against thy two friends: for ye haue not spoken of mee the thing that is right, as my seruant Iob hath.
\p
\v 8 Therefore take vnto you now seuen bullocks, and seuen rammes, and goe to my seruant Iob, and offer vp for your selues a burnt offring, and my seruant Iob shal pray for you, for him wil I accept: lest I deale with you after your folly, in that ye haue not spoken of mee the thing which is right, like my seruant Iob.
\p
\v 9 So Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the Lord commanded them: the Lord also accepted Iob.
\p
\v 10 And the Lord turned the captiuitie of Iob, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gaue Iob twice as much as he had before.
\p
\v 11 Then came there vnto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had bin of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoned him, and comforted him ouer all the euill that the Lord had brought vpon him: euery man also gaue him a piece of money, and euery one an eare-ring of gold.
\p
\v 12 So the Lord blessed the latter end of Iob, more then his beginning: for he had fourteene thousand sheepe, and sixe thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand shee asses.
\p
\v 13 He had also seuen sonnes, and three daughters.
\p
\v 14 And he called the name of the first, Iemima, and the name of the second, Kezia, and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.
\p
\v 15 And in all the land were no women found so faire as the daughters of Iob: and their father gaue them inheritance among their brethren.
\p
\v 16 After this liued Iob an hundred and fourtie yeeres, and saw his sonnes, and his sonnes sonnes, euen foure generations.
\p
\v 17 So Iob died being old, and full of dayes.
