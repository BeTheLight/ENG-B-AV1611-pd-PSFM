\h1 MICAH 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 The word of the Lord that came to Micah the Morasthite in the dayes of Iotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah Kings of Iudah, which hee saw concerning Samaria and Ierusalem.
\p
\v 2 Heare all ye people, hearken O earth, and all that therein is, and let the Lord God be witnesse against you, the Lord from his holy temple.
\p
\v 3 For behold, the Lord commeth forth out of his place, and will come downe and tread vpon the high places of the earth.
\p
\v 4 And the mountaines shall be molten vnder him, and the valleis shall be cleft: as waxe before the fire, and as the waters that are powred downe a steepe place.
\p
\v 5 For the transgression of Iacob is all this, and for the sinnes of the house of Israel: What is the transgression of Iacob? Is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Iudah? are they not Ierusalem?
\p
\v 6 Therfore I will make Samaria as an heape of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard; and I will powre downe the stones therof into the valley, and I will discouer the foundations thereof.
\p
\v 7 And all the grauen images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burnt with the fire, and all the idoles therof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall returne to the hire of an harlot.
\p
\v 8 Therfore I wil waile and houle, I will goe stript and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owles.
\p
\v 9 For her wound is incurable, for it is come vnto Iudah: he is come vnto the gate of my people, euen to Ierusalem.
\p
\v 10 ¶ Declare yee it not at Gath, weepe yee not at all: In the house of Aphrah rowle thy selfe in the dust.
\p
\v 11 Passe yee away thou inhabitant of Saphir, hauing thy shame naked; the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel, he shall receiue of you his standing.
\p
\v 12 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good, but euill came downe from the Lord vnto the gate of Ierusalem.
\p
\v 13 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the charet to the swift beast: she is the beginning of the sinne to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
\p
\v 14 Therfore shalt thou giue presents to Moresheth-Gath: the houses of Achzib shalbe a lie to &thorn;e kings of Israel.
\p
\v 15 Yet wil I bring an heire vnto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come vnto Adullam, the glory of Israel
\p
\v 16 Make thee bald, and polle thee for thy delicate children, enlarge thy baldnesse as the Eagle, for they are gone into captiuitie from thee.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 Woe to them that deuise iniquitie, and worke euill vpon their beds: when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.
\p
\v 2 And they couet fields and take them by violence: and houses, and take them away: so they oppresse a man and his house, euen a man and his heritage.
\p
\v 3 Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, against this familie doe I deuise an euill, from which ye shall not remoue your necks, neither shall ye goe haughtily: for this time is euill.
\p
\v 4 ¶ In that day shall one take vp a parable against you, and lament with a dolefull lamentation, and say, We be vtterly spoiled: hee hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he remoued it from me? turning away hee hath diuided our fields.
\p
\v 5 Therefore thou shalt haue none that shall cast a cord by lot in the Congregation of the Lord.
\p
\v 6 Prophecie ye not, say they, to them that prophecie: they shall not prophecie to them, that they shall not take shame.
\p
\v 7 ¶ O thou that art named the house of Iacob, is the Spirit of the Lord straitned? are these his dongs? doe not my words do good to him that walketh vprightly?
\p
\v 8 Euen of late, my people is risen vp as an enemie: ye pull off the robe with the garment, fr&#333; them that passe by securely, as men auerse from warre.
\p
\v 9 The women of my people haue ye cast out from their pleasant houses, from their children haue ye taken away my glory for euer.
\p
\v 10 Arise ye and depart, for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy you euen with a sore destruction.
\p
\v 11 If a man walking in the spirit and falshood, doe lie, saying, I will prophecie vnto thee of wine and of strong drinke, he shall euen bee the prophet of this people.
\p
\v 12 ¶ I will surely assemble, O Iacob, all of thee: I will surely gather the remnant of Israel, I will put them together as the sheepe of Bozrah, as the flocke in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.
\p
\v 13 The breaker is come vp before them: they haue broken vp and haue passed through the gate, and are gone out by it, and their king shal passe before them, & the Lord on the head of them.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 And I said, Heare, I pray you, O heads of Iacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel: is it not for you to know iudgement?
\p
\v 2 Who hate the good and loue the euill, who plucke off their skinne from off them, and their flesh from off their bones.
\p
\v 3 Who also eate the flesh of my people, and flay their skinne from off them, and they breake their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the cauldron.
\p
\v 4 Then shall they cry vnto the Lord, but he will not heare them: he will euen hide his face from them at that time, as they haue behaued themselues ill in their doings.
\p
\v 5 ¶ Thus saith the Lord concerning the Prophets that make my people erre, that bite with their teeth and crie; Peace: and he that putteth not into their mouths, they euen prepare warre against him:
\p
\v 6 Therefore night shall be vnto you, that yee shall not haue a vision, and it shall be darke vnto you, that yee shall not diuine, and the Sunne shall goe downe ouer the Prophets, and the day shall be darke ouer them.
\p
\v 7 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diuiners confounded: yea, they shall all couer their lips; for there is no answere of God.
\p
\v 8 ¶ But truely I am full of power by the spirit of the Lord, and of iudgment and of might, to declare vnto Iacob his transgression, and to Israel his sinne.
\p
\v 9 Heare this, I pray you, yee heads of the house of Iacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhorre iudgement and peruert all equitie.
\p
\v 10 They build vp Zion with blood, and Ierusalem with iniquitie.
\p
\v 11 The heads thereof iudge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hyre, and the Prophets thereof diuine for money: yet will they leane vpon the Lord, and say; Is not the Lord among vs? none euill can come vpon vs.
\p
\v 12 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Ierusalem shal become heapes, and the mountaine of the house, as the high places of the forrest.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 But in the last dayes it shal come to passe, that the mountaine of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountaines, and it shalbe exalted aboue the hilles, and people shall flow vnto it.
\p
\v 2 And many nations shall come, and say; Come, and let vs goe vp to the mountaine of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Iacob, and he will teach vs of his wayes, and wee will walke in his pathes: for the Law shall goe foorth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Ierusalem.
\p
\v 3 ¶ And he shall iudge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afarre off, and they shall beate their swords into plowshares, and their speares into pruning hookes: nation shall not lift vp a sword against nation, neither shall they learne warre any more.
\p
\v 4 But they shall sit euery man vnder his Uine, and vnder his figgetree, and none shal make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hostes hath spoken it.
\p
\v 5 For all people will walke euery one in the name of his god, and we will walke in the Name of the Lord our God for euer and euer.
\p
\v 6 In that day, saith the Lord, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driuen out, and her that I haue afflicted.
\p
\v 7 And I will make her that halted, a remnant; and her that was cast farre off, a strong nation; and the Lord shall reigne ouer them, in Mount Zion from hencefoorth, euen for euer.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And thou, O towre of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, vnto thee shall it come, euen the first dominion, the kingdome shall come to the daughter of Ierusalem.
\p
\v 9 Now why doest thou cry out alowd? is there no king in thee? is thy counseller perished? for pangs haue taken thee, as a woman in trauell.
\p
\v 10 Bee in paine and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in trauell: for now shalt thou goe foorth out of the citie, and thou shalt dwel in the field, and thou shalt go euen to Babylon: there shalt thou be deliuered: there the Lord shall redeeme thee from the hand of thine enemies.
\p
\v 11 ¶ Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, & let our eye look vpon Zion.
\p
\v 12 But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither vnderstand they his counsell: for hee shall gather them as the sheaues into the floore.
\p
\v 13 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horne yron, & I will make thy hooues brasse, and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gaine vnto the Lord, and their substance vnto the Lord of the whole earth.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 Now gather thy selfe in troupes, O daughter of troupes: he hath laid siege against vs: they shal smite the Iudge of Israel with a rod vpon the cheeke.
\p
\v 2 But thou Beth-leem Ephratah, though thou bee little among the thousands of Iudah, yet out of thee shall he come foorth vnto mee, that is to be ruler in Israel: whose goings foorth haue bene from of old, from euerlasting.
\p
\v 3 Therefore will hee giue them vp, vntill the time that shee which trauaileth, hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall returne vnto the children of Israel.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the Maiestie of the Name of the Lord his God, and they shall abide: for now shall he be great vnto the ends of the earth.
\p
\v 5 And this man shall bee the peace when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when hee shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seuen Shepheards, and eight principall men.
\p
\v 6 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall hee deliuer vs from the Assyrian, when he commeth into our land, and when hee treadeth within our borders.
\p
\v 7 And the remnant of Iacob shall be in the midst of many people, as a dew from the Lord, as the showres vpon the grasse that tarieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sonnes of men.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the remnant of Iacob shal be among the Gentiles in the middest of many people, as a Lyon among the beasts of the forrest, as a yong Lyon among the flockes of sheepe: who if he goe through, both treadeth downe, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliuer.
\p
\v 9 Thine hand shall be lift vp vpon thine aduersaries, and all thine enemies shalbe cut off.
\p
\v 10 And it shall come to passe in that day, sayth the Lord, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy charets.
\p
\v 11 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw downe all thy strong holdes.
\p
\v 12 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand, and thou shalt haue no more Southsayers.
\p
\v 13 Thy grauen images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee: & thou shalt no more worship the worke of thine hands.
\p
\v 14 And I will plucke vp thy groues out of the middest of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.
\p
\v 15 And I will execute vengeance in anger, and furie vpon the heathen, such as they haue not heard.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 Heare yee now what the Lord saith, Arise, contend thou before the mountaines, and let the hilles heare thy voice.
\p
\v 2 Heare yee, O mountaines, the Lords controuersie, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the Lord hath a controuersie with his people, and he will pleade with Israel.
\p
\v 3 O my people, what haue I done vnto thee, and wherein haue I wearied thee? testifie against me.
\p
\v 4 For I brought thee vp out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of seruants, and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron and Miriam.
\p
\v 5 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the sonne of Beor answered him from Shittim vnto Gilgal, that yee may know the righteousnesse of the Lord.
\p
\v 6 ¶ Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow my selfe before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calues of a yeere olde?
\p
\v 7 Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rammes, or with tenne thousands of riuers of oyle? shall I giue my first borne for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sinne of my soule?
\p
\v 8 Hee hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doeth the Lord require of thee, but to do iustly, and to loue mercy, and to walke humbly with thy God?
\p
\v 9 The Lords voice cryeth vnto the citie, and the man of wisedome shall see thy Name: heare ye the rodde, and who hath appointed it.
\p
\v 10 ¶ Are there yet the treasures of wickednesse in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable.
\p
\v 11 Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitfull weights?
\p
\v 12 For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof haue spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitfull in their mouth.
\p
\v 13 Therefore also will I make thee sicke in smiting thee, in making thee desolate, because of thy sinnes.
\p
\v 14 Thou shalt eate, but not be satisfied, and thy casting downe shall be in the midst of thee, and thou shalt take holde, but shalt not deliuer: & that which thou deliuerest, will I giue vp to the sword.
\p
\v 15 Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reape: thou shalt tread the oliues, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oile; & sweet wine, but shalt not drinke wine.
\p
\v 16 ¶ For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the workes of the house of Ahab, and ye walke in their counsels, that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore yee shall beare the reproch of my people.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 Woe is mee, for I am as when they haue gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eate: my soule desired the first ripe fruit.
\p
\v 2 The good man is perished out of the earth, and there is none vpright among men: they all lie in waite for blood: they hunt euery man his brother with a net.
\p
\v 3 ¶ That they may doe euill with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the iudge asketh for a reward: and the great man, he vttereth his mischieuous desire: so they wrap it vp.
\p
\v 4 The best of them is as a brier: the most vpright is sharper then a thorne hedge: the day of thy watchmen, and thy visitation commeth; now shall be their perplexitie.
\p
\v 5 ¶ Trust yee not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keepe the doores of thy mouth from her that lyeth in thy bosome.
\p
\v 6 For the sonne dishonoureth the father: the daughter riseth vp against her mother: the daughter in law against her mother in law; a mans enemies are the men of his owne house.
\p
\v 7 Therefore I will looke vnto you the Lord: I will waite for the God of my saluation: my God will heare me.
\p
\v 8 ¶ Reioyce not against mee, O mine enemie: When I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darknes, the Lord shall be a light vnto me.
\p
\v 9 I will beare the indignation of the Lord, because I haue sinned against him, vntill he plead my cause, and execute iudgement for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousnesse.
\p
\v 10 Then she that is mine enemie shall see it, and shame shall couer her which said vnto mee; Where is the Lord thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she bee troden downe, as the myre of the streets.
\p
\v 11 In the day that thy walles are to be built, in that day shall the decree bee farre remoued.
\p
\v 12 In that day also he shal come euen to thee from Assyria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortresse euen to the riuer, and from Sea to Sea, and from mountaine to mountaine;
\p
\v 13 Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruite of their doings.
\p
\v 14 ¶ Feede thy people with thy rod, the flocke of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feede in Bashan and Gilead, as in the dayes of old.
\p
\v 15 According to the dayes of thy comming out of the land of Egypt will I shew vnto him meruailous things.
\p
\v 16 ¶ The nations shall see, and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay their hand vpon their mouth: their eares shall be deafe.
\p
\v 17 They shall licke the dust like a serpent, they shall moue out of their holes like wormes of the earth: they shall be afraid of the Lord our God, and shall feare because of thee.
\p
\v 18 Who is a God like vnto thee, that pardoneth iniquitie, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? hee retaineth not his anger for euer, because he delighteth in mercy.
\p
\v 19 He wil turne againe, he will haue compassion vpon vs: he will subdue our iniquities, and thou wilt cast all their sinnes into the depths of the Sea.
\p
\v 20 Thou wilt performe the trueth to Iacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworne vnto our fathers from the dayes of old.
