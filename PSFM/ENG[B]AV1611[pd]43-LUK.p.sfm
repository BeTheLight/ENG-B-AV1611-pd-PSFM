\p
\v 1 Forasmuch as many haue taken in hande to set foorth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely beleeued among vs,
\p
\v 2 Euen as they deliuered them vnto vs, which from the beginning were eye-witnesses, & ministers of the word:
\p
\v 3 It seemed good to me also, hauing had perfect vnderstanding of things from the very first, to write vnto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,
\p
\v 4 That thou mightest know the certainetie of those things wherein thou hast bene instructed.
\p
\v 5 ¶ There was in the dayes of Herode the king of Iudea, a certaine Priest, named Zacharias, of the course of Abia, and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
\p
\v 6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the Commandements and ordinances of the Lord, blamelesse.
\p
\v 7 And they had no childe, because that Elizabeth was barren, and they both were now well striken in yeeres.
\p
\v 8 And it came to passe, that while he executed the Priests office before God in the order of his course,
\p
\v 9 According to the custome of the Priests office, his lot was to burne incense when he went into the Temple of the Lord.
\p
\v 10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense.
\p
\v 11 And there appeared vnto him an Angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the Altar of incense.
\p
\v 12 And when Zacharias sawe him, hee was troubled, and feare fell vpon him.
\p
\v 13 But the Angel said vnto him, Feare not, Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall beare thee a sonne, and thou shalt call his name Iohn.
\p
\v 14 And thou shalt haue ioy and gladnesse, and many shall reioyce at his birth:
\p
\v 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shal drinke neither wine, nor strong drinke, and he shall bee filled with the holy Ghost, euen from his mothers wombe.
\p
\v 16 And many of the children of Israel shall hee turne to the Lord their God.
\p
\v 17 And hee shall goe before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turne the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisedome of the iust, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
\p
\v 18 And Zacharias said vnto the Angel, Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife well striken in yeeres.
\p
\v 19 And the Angel answering, said vnto him, I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speake vnto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.
\p
\v 20 And behold, thou shalt be dumbe, and not able to speake, vntill the day that these things shall bee performed, because thou beleeuest not my words, which shall bee fulfilled in their season.
\p
\v 21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and maruelled that hee taried so long in the temple.
\p
\v 22 And when he came out, he could not speake vnto them: and they perceiued that he had seene a vision in the temple: for he beckened vnto them, and remained speechlesse.
\p
\v 23 And it came to passe, that as soone as the dayes of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his owne house.
\p
\v 24 And after those dayes his wife Elizabeth conceiued, and hid her selfe fiue moneths, saying,
\p
\v 25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the dayes wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproch among men.
\p
\v 26 And in the sixt moneth, the Angel Gabriel was sent from God, vnto a citie of Galilee, named Nazareth,
\p
\v 27 To a virgine espoused to a man whose name was Ioseph, of the house of Dauid, and the virgins name was Marie.
\p
\v 28 And the Angel came in vnto her, and said, Haile thou that art highly fauoured, the Lord is with thee: Blessed art thou among women.
\p
\v 29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her minde what maner of salutation this should be.
\p
\v 30 And the Angel said vnto her, Feare not, Marie, for thou hast found fauour with God.
\p
\v 31 And behold, thou shalt conceiue in thy wombe, and bring forth a sonne, and shalt call his name Iesus.
\p
\v 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the sonne of the Highest, and the Lord God shall giue vnto him the throne of his father Dauid.
\p
\v 33 And hee shall reigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdome there shall be no end.
\p
\v 34 Then said Marie vnto the Angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
\p
\v 35 And the Angel answered and said vnto her, The holy Ghost shall come vpon thee, and the power of the Highest shall ouershadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall bee borne of thee, shall bee called the sonne of God.
\p
\v 36 And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also conceiued a sonne in her old age, and this is the sixt moneth with her, who was called barren.
\p
\v 37 For with God no thing shall be vnpossible.
\p
\v 38 And Marie said, Behold the handmaide of the Lord, be it vnto me according to thy word: and the Angel departed from her.
\p
\v 39 And Marie arose in those dayes, and went into the hill countrey with haste, into a citie of Iuda,
\p
\v 40 And entred into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth.
\p
\v 41 And it came to passe that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Marie, the babe leaped in her wombe, and Elizabeth was filled with the holy Ghost.
\p
\v 42 And she spake out with a loud voyce, and saide, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruite of thy wombe.
\p
\v 43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to mee?
\p
\v 44 For loe, assoone as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine eares, the babe leaped in my wombe for ioy.
\p
\v 45 And blessed is she that beleeued, for there shalbe a performance of those things, which were told her from the Lord.
\p
\v 46 And Marie said, My soule doth magnifie the Lord.
\p
\v 47 And my spirit hath reioyced in God my sauiour.
\p
\v 48 For hee hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for behold, from hencefoorth all generations shall call me blessed.
\p
\v 49 For he that is mighty hath done to mee great things, and holy is his Name.
\p
\v 50 And his mercy is on them that feare him, from generation to generation.
\p
\v 51 Hee hath shewed strength with his arme, he hath scattered the proud, in the imagination of their hearts.
\p
\v 52 He hath put downe the mighty from their seates, and exalted them of low degree.
\p
\v 53 Hee hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich hee hath sent emptie away.
\p
\v 54 Hee hath holpen his seruant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,
\p
\v 55 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for euer.
\p
\v 56 And Mary abode with her about three moneths, and returned to her owne house.
\p
\v 57 Now Elizabeths full time came, that shee should be deliuered, and shee brought foorth a sonne.
\p
\v 58 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy vpon her, and they reioyced with her.
\p
\v 59 And it came to passe that on the eight day they came to circumcise the childe, and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.
\p
\v 60 And his mother answered, and said, Not so, but he shalbe called Iohn.
\p
\v 61 And they said vnto her, There is none of thy kinred that is called by this name.
\p
\v 62 And they made signes to his father, how he would haue him called.
\p
\v 63 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is Iohn: and they marueiled all.
\p
\v 64 And his mouth was opened immediatly, and his tongue loosed, and hee spake, and praised God.
\p
\v 65 And feare came on all that dwelt round about them, and all these sayings were noised abroad thorowout all the hill countrey of Iudea.
\p
\v 66 And all they that had heard them, layde them vp in their hearts, saying, What maner of childe shal this be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.
\p
\v 67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,
\p
\v 68 Blessed bee the Lord God of Israel, for hee hath visited and redeemed his people,
\p
\v 69 And hath raised vp an horne of saluation for vs, in the house of his seruant Dauid,
\p
\v 70 As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets, which haue bene since the world began:
\p
\v 71 That wee should be saued from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate vs,
\p
\v 72 To performe the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy Couenant,
\p
\v 73 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,
\p
\v 74 That hee would grant vnto vs, that wee beeing deliuered out of the hands of our enemies, might serue him without feare,
\p
\v 75 In holinesse and righteousnesse before him, all the dayes of our life.
\p
\v 76 And thou childe shalt bee called the Prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt goe before the face of the Lord to prepare his wayes.
\p
\v 77 To giue knowledge of saluation vnto his people, by the remission of their sinnes,
\p
\v 78 Through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the day-spring from on high hath visited vs,
\p
\v 79 To giue light to them that sit in darknes, and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
\p
\v 80 And the childe grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts, till the day of his shewing vnto Israel.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe in those dayes, that there went out a decree from Cesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.
\p
\v 2 (And this taxing was first made wh&#275; Cyrenius was gouernor of Syria)
\p
\v 3 And all went to bee taxed, euery one into his owne citie.
\p
\v 4 And Ioseph also w&#275;t vp fr&#333; Galilee, out of the citie of Nazareth, into Iudea, vnto the citie of Dauid, which is called Bethlehem, (because he was of the house and linage of Dauid,)
\p
\v 5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.
\p
\v 6 And so it was, that while they were there, the dayes were accomplished that she should be deliuered.
\p
\v 7 And she brought foorth her first borne sonne, and wrapped him in swadling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no roome for them in the Inne.
\p
\v 8 And there were in the same countrey shepheards abiding in &thorn;e field, keeping watch ouer their flocke by night.
\p
\v 9 And loe, the Angel of the Lord came vpon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid.
\p
\v 10 And the Angel said vnto them, Feare not: For behold, I bring you good tidings of great ioy, which shall be to all people.
\p
\v 11 For vnto you is borne this day, in the citie of Dauid, a Sauiour, which is Christ the Lord.
\p
\v 12 And this shall be a signe vnto you; yee shall find the babe wrapped in swadling clothes lying in a manger.
\p
\v 13 And suddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of the heauenly hoste praising God, and saying,
\p
\v 14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good wil towards men.
\p
\v 15 And it came to passe, as the Angels were gone away from them into heauen, the shepheards said one to another, Let vs now goe euen vnto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to passe, which the Lord hath made knowen vnto vs.
\p
\v 16 And they came with haste, and found Mary and Ioseph, and the babe lying in a manger.
\p
\v 17 And when they had seene it, they made knowen abroad the saying, which was told them, concerning this child.
\p
\v 18 And all they that heard it, wondered at those things, which were tolde them by the shepheards.
\p
\v 19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.
\p
\v 20 And the shepheards returned, glorifying & praising God for all the things that they had heard and seene, as it was told vnto them.
\p
\v 21 And when eight dayes were accomplished for the circumcising of the childe, his name was called Iesus, which was so named of the Angel before he was conceiued in the wombe.
\p
\v 22 And when the dayes of her purification according to the law of Moses, were accomplished, they brought him to Hierusalem, to present him to the Lord,
\p
\v 23 (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Euery male that openeth the wombe, shalbe called holy to the Lord)
\p
\v 24 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the Law of the Lord, a paire of turtle doues, or two yong pigeons.
\p
\v 25 And behold, there was a man in Hierusalem, whose name was Simeon, and the same man was iust and deuout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the holy Ghost was vpon him.
\p
\v 26 And it was reuealed vnto him by the holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seene the Lords Christ.
\p
\v 27 And hee came by the spirit into the Temple: and when the parents brought in the child Iesus, to doe for him after the custome of the Lawe,
\p
\v 28 Then tooke hee him vp in his armes, and blessed God, and said,
\p
\v 29 Lord now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace, according to thy word.
\p
\v 30 For mine eyes haue seene thy saluation.
\p
\v 31 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people.
\p
\v 32 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.
\p
\v 33 And Ioseph and his mother marueiled at those things which were spoken of him.
\p
\v 34 And Simeon blessed them, and said vnto Marie his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising againe of many in Israel: and for a signe which shall be spoken against,
\p
\v 35 (Yea a sword shall pearce thorow thy owne soule also) that the thoughts of many hearts may be reuealed.
\p
\v 36 And there was one Anna a Prophetesse, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; she was of a great age, and had liued with an husband seuen yeeres from her virginitie.
\p
\v 37 And she was a widow of about fourescore and foure yeeres, which departed not from the Temple, but serued God with fastings and prayers night and day.
\p
\v 38 And she comming in that instant, gaue thankes likewise vnto the Lord, and spake of him to al them that looked for redemption in Hierusalem.
\p
\v 39 And when they had performed all things according to the Lawe of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their owne citie Nazareth.
\p
\v 40 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisedome, and the grace of God was vpon him.
\p
\v 41 Now his parents went to Hierusalem euery yeere, at the feast of the Passeouer.
\p
\v 42 And when he was twelue yeeres old, they went vp to Hierusalem, after the custome of the feast.
\p
\v 43 And when they had fulfilled the dayes, as they returned, the childe Iesus taried behind in Hierusalem, and Ioseph and his mother knew not of it.
\p
\v 44 But they supposing him to haue bene in the company, went a daies iourney, and they sought him among their kinsefolke and acquaintance.
\p
\v 45 And when they found him not, they turned backe againe to Hierusalem, seeking him.
\p
\v 46 And it came to passe, that after three daies they found him in the Temple, sitting in the midst of the Doctours, both hearing them, and asking them questions.
\p
\v 47 And all that heard him were astonished at his vnderstanding, and answeres.
\p
\v 48 And when they sawe him, they were amazed: and his mother said vnto him, Sonne, why hast thou thus dealt with vs? Behold, thy father and I haue sought thee sorrowing.
\p
\v 49 And he said vnto them, How is it that ye sought me? Wist yee not that I must bee about my fathers businesse?
\p
\v 50 And they vnderstood not the saying which he spake vnto them.
\p
\v 51 And he went downe with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subiect vnto them: But his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
\p
\v 52 And Iesus increased in wisedom and stature, and in fauour with God and man.

\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now in the fifteenth yeere of the reigne of Tiberius Cesar, Pontius Pilate being Gouernour of Iudea, & Herode being Tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip Tetrarch of Iturea, and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the Tetrarch of Abilene,
\p
\v 2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high Priests, the word of God came vnto Iohn the sonne of Zacharias, in the wildernesse.
\p
\v 3 And he came into all the countrey about Iordane, preaching the baptisme of repentance, for the remissi&#333; of sinnes,
\p
\v 4 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the Prophet, saying, The voyce of one crying in the wildernesse, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
\p
\v 5 Euery valley shall be filled, and euery mountaine and hill shalbe brought low, and the crooked shall bee made straight, and the rough wayes shall be made smooth.
\p
\v 6 And all flesh shal see the saluation of God.
\p
\v 7 Then said hee to the multitude that came forth to bee baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\p
\v 8 Bring forth therfore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within your selues, We haue Abraham to our father: For I say vnto you, that God is able of these stones to raise vp children vnto Abraham.
\p
\v 9 And now also the axe is laid vnto the root of the trees: Euery tree therefore which bringeth not foorth good fruit, is hewen downe, and cast into the fire.
\p
\v 10 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we doe then?
\p
\v 11 He answereth, and saith vnto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none, and he that hath meat, let him doe likewise.
\p
\v 12 Then came also Publicanes to be baptized, and said vnto him, Master, what shall we doe?
\p
\v 13 And he said vnto them, Exact no more then that which is appointed you.
\p
\v 14 And the souldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we doe? And he said vnto them, Doe violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely, & be content with your wages.
\p
\v 15 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of Iohn, whether he were the Christ or not:
\p
\v 16 Iohn answered, saying vnto them all, I indeede baptize you with water, but one mightier then I commeth, the latchet of whose shooes I am not worthy to vnloose, he shall baptize you with the holy Ghost, and with fire.
\p
\v 17 Whose fanne is in his hand, and he will thorowly purge his floore, and will gather the wheat into his garner, but the chaffe he will burne with fire vnquencheable.
\p
\v 18 And many other things in his exhortation preached he vnto the people.
\p
\v 19 But Herode the Tetrarch being reprooued by him for Herodias his brother Philips wife, and for all the euils which Herode had done,
\p
\v 20 Added yet this aboue all, that he shut vp Iohn in prison.
\p
\v 21 Now when all the people were baptized, and it came to passe that Iesus also being baptized, and praying, the heauen was opened:
\p
\v 22 And the holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a Doue vpon him, and a voice came from heauen, which said, Thou art my beloued sonne, in thee I am well pleased.
\p
\v 23 And Iesus himselfe began to be about thirty yeeres of age, being (as was supposed) the sonne of Ioseph, which was the sonne of Heli,

\v 24 Which was the sonne of Matthat, which was the sonne of Leui, which was the sonne of Melchi, which was the sonne of Ianna, which was the sonne of Ioseph,

\p
\v 29 Which was the sonne of Iose, which was the sonne of Eliezer, which was the sonne of Iorim, which was the sonne of Matthat, which was the sonne of Leui,
\p
\v 30 Which was the sonne of Simeon, which was the sonne of Iuda, which was the sonne of Ioseph, which was the sonne of Ionan, which was the sonne of Eliakim,
\p

\p

\c 4
\p
\v 1 And Iesus being full of the holy Ghost, returned from Iordane, and was led by the spirit into the wildernesse,
\p
\v 2 Being fourtie dayes tempted of the deuil, and in those dayes he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungred.
\p
\v 3 And the deuil saide vnto him, If thou be the Sonne of God, command this stone that it be made bread.
\p
\v 4 And Iesus answered him, saying, It is written, that man shall not liue by bread alone, but by euery word of God.
\p
\v 5 And the deuil taking him vp into an high mountaine, shewed vnto him all the kingdomes of the world in a moment of time.
\p
\v 6 And the deuil said vnto him, All this power will I giue thee, and the glory of them; for that is deliuered vnto me, & to whomsoeuer I will, I giue it.
\p
\v 7 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shalbe thine.
\p
\v 8 And Iesus answered and said vnto him, Get thee behinde me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue.
\p
\v 9 And hee brought him to Hierusalem, and set him on a pinacle of the Temple, and said vnto him, If thou be the Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe from hence.
\p
\v 10 For it is written, He shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee, to keepe thee.
\p
\v 11 And in their handes they shall beare thee vp, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
\p
\v 12 And Iesus answering, said vnto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
\p
\v 13 And when the deuil had ended all the temptation, hee departed from him for a season.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And Iesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.
\p
\v 15 And hee taught in their Synagogues, being glorified of all.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And hee came to Nazareth, where he had bene brought vp, and as his custome was, he went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood vp for to reade.
\p
\v 17 And there was deliuered vnto him the booke of the Prophet Esaias, and when he had opened the Booke, he found the place where it was written,
\p
\v 18 The Spirit of the Lord is vpon mee, because hee hath anointed mee, to preach the Gospel to the poore, he hath sent mee to heale the broken hearted, to preach deliuerance to the captiues, and recouering of sight to the blinde, to set at libertie them that are bruised,
\p
\v 19 To preach the acceptable yeere of the Lord.
\p
\v 20 And he closed the booke, and hee gaue it againe to the minister, and sate downe: and the eyes of all them that were in the Synagogue were fastened on him.
\p
\v 21 And hee began to say vnto them, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares.
\p
\v 22 And all bare him witnesse, and wondered at the gracious wordes, which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Iosephs sonne?
\p
\v 23 And hee said vnto them, Yee will surely say vnto me this prouerbe, Physition, heale thy selfe: Whatsoeuer wee haue heard done in Capernaum, doe also here in thy countrey.
\p
\v 24 And hee said, Verely I say vnto you, no Prophet is accepted in his owne countrey.
\p
\v 25 But I tell you of a trueth, many widowes were in Israel in the dayes of Elias, when the heauen was shut vp three yeres and sixe moneths: when great famine was throughout all the land:
\p
\v 26 But vnto none of them was Elias sent, saue vnto Sarepta a citie of Sidon, vnto a woman that was a widow.
\p
\v 27 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elizeus the Prophet: and none of them was cleansed, sauing Naaman the Syrian.
\p
\v 28 And all they in the Synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,
\p
\v 29 And rose vp, and thrust him out of the citie, & led him vnto the brow of the hill (whereon their city was built) that they might cast him downe headlong.
\p
\v 30 But he passing thorow the mids of them, went his way:
\p
\v 31 And came downe to Capernaum, a citie of Galile, and taught them on the Sabbath dayes.
\p
\v 32 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his worde was with power.
\p
\v 33 ¶ And in the Synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an vncleane deuill, and cryed out with a loud voice,
\p
\v 34 Saying, Let vs alone, what haue wee to doe with thee, thou Iesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy vs? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
\p
\v 35 And Iesus rebuked him, saying, Holde thy peace, and come out of him. And when the deuill had throwen him in the middes, hee came out of him, and hurt him not.
\p
\v 36 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselues, saying, What a word is this? for with authoritie and power hee commaundeth the vncleane spirits, and they come out.
\p
\v 37 And the fame of him went out into euery place of the countrey round about.
\p
\v 38 ¶ And he arose out of the Synagogue, and entred into Simons house: and Simons wiues mother was taken with a great feuer, and they besought him for her.
\p
\v 39 And he stood ouer her, and rebuked the feuer, & it left her. And immediatly she arose, & ministred vnto them.
\p
\v 40 ¶ Now when the Sunne was setting, all they that had any sicke with diuers diseases, brought them vnto him: and hee laid his handes on euery one of them, and healed them.
\p
\v 41 And deuils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Sonne of God. And hee rebuking them, suffered them not to speake: for they knewe that hee was Christ.
\p
\v 42 And when it was day, he departed, and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came vnto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.
\p
\v 43 And hee said vnto them, I must preach the kingdome of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.
\p
\v 44 And hee preached in the Synagogues of Galile.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe, that as the people preassed vpon him to heare the word of God, hee stood by the lake of Genesareth,
\p
\v 2 And sawe two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.
\p
\v 3 And he entred into one of the ships, which was Simons, and prayed him, that he would thrust out a little from the land: and he sate downe, and taught the people out of the ship.
\p
\v 4 Now when he had left speaking, he said vnto Simon, Lanch out into the deepe, and let downe your nets for a draught.
\p
\v 5 And Simon answering, said vnto him, Master, wee haue toiled all the night, and haue taken nothing: neuerthelesse at thy word I will let downe the net.
\p
\v 6 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net brake:
\p
\v 7 And they beckened vnto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and helpe them. And they came, & filled both the ships, so that they began to sinke.
\p
\v 8 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell downe at Iesus knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinfull man, O Lord.
\p
\v 9 For he was astonished, and al that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken.
\p
\v 10 And so was also Iames, and Iohn the sonnes of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Iesus said vnto Simon, Feare not, from henceforth thou shalt catch men.
\p
\v 11 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsooke all, and followed him.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And it came to passe, when he was in a certaine citie, behold a man full of leprosie: who seeing Iesus, fell on his face, & besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane.
\p
\v 13 And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I wil: be thou cleane. And immediatly the leprosie departed from him.
\p
\v 14 And hee charged him to tell no man: but, Goe, and shewe thy selfe to the Priest, and offer for thy clensing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimonie vnto them.
\p
\v 15 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him, and great multitudes came together to heare, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And he withdrew himselfe into the wildernesse, and prayed.
\p
\v 17 And it came to passe on a certaine day, as hee was teaching, that there were Pharisees and Doctours of the Law sitting by, which were come out of euery towne of Galilee, and Iudea, and Hierusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heale them.
\p
\v 18 ¶ And behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsie: and they sought meanes to bring him in, and to lay him before him.
\p
\v 19 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went vpon the house top, & let him downe through the tiling with his couch, into the midst before Iesus.
\p
\v 20 And when he saw their faith, hee said vnto him, Man, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.
\p
\v 21 And the Scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgiue sinnes, but God alone?
\p
\v 22 But when Iesus perceiued their thoughts, he answering, saide vnto them, What reason ye in your hearts?
\p
\v 23 Whether is easier to say, Thy sinnes be forgiuen thee: or to say, Rise vp and walke?
\p
\v 24 But that ye may know that the Sonne of man hath power vpon earth to forgiue sinnes (he said vnto the sicke of the palsie,) I say vnto thee, Arise, and take vp thy couch, and go into thine house.
\p
\v 25 And immediatly he rose vp before them, and tooke vp that whereon hee lay, and departed to his owne house, glorifying God.
\p
\v 26 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with feare, saying, Wee haue seene strange things to day.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And after these things hee went foorth, and sawe a Publicane, named Leui, sitting at the receit of custome: and hee said vnto him, Follow me.
\p
\v 28 And he left all, rose vp, and followed him.
\p
\v 29 And Leui made him a great feast in his owne house: and there was a great company of Publicanes, and of others that sate downe with them.
\p
\v 30 But their Scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why doe ye eate and drinke with Publicanes and sinners?
\p
\v 31 And Iesus answering, said vnto them, They that are whole need not a physician: but they that are sicke.
\p
\v 32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
\p
\v 33 ¶ And they said vnto him, Why doe the disciples of Iohn fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees: but thine eat and drinke?
\p
\v 34 And he said vnto them, Can yee make the children of the Bride-chamber fast, while the Bridegrome is with them?
\p
\v 35 But the dayes will come, when the Bridegrome shall bee taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those dayes.
\p
\v 36 ¶ And he spake also a parable vnto them, No man putteth a piece of a newe garment vpon an olde: if otherwise, then both the newe maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new, agreeth not with the olde.
\p
\v 37 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.
\p
\v 38 But newe wine must be put into newe bottles, and both are preserued.
\p
\v 39 No man also hauing drunke olde wine, straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe on the second Sabbath after the first, that he went thorow the corne fields: and his disciples plucked the eares of corne, and did eate, rubbing them in their hands.
\p
\v 2 And certaine of the Pharisees said vnto them, Why doe yee that which is not lawfull to doe on the Sabbath dayes?
\p
\v 3 And Iesus answering them, said, Haue yee not read so much as this what Dauid did, when himselfe was an hungred, and they which were with him:
\p
\v 4 How he went into the house of God, and did take and eate the Shew bread, and gaue also to them that were with him, which it is not lawful to eate but for the Priests alone?
\p
\v 5 And he said vnto them, That the sonne of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.
\p
\v 6 And it came to passe also on another Sabbath, that he entred into the Synagogue, and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.
\p
\v 7 And the Scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heale on the Sabbath day: that they might find an accusation against him.
\p
\v 8 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise vp, and stand foorth in the mids. And he arose, and stood foorth.
\p
\v 9 Then said Iesus vnto them, I will aske you one thing, Is it lawfull on the Sabbath dayes to doe good, or to doe euill? to saue life, or to destroy it?
\p
\v 10 And looking round about vpon them all, he said vnto the man, Stretch foorth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
\p
\v 11 And they were filled with madnesse, and communed one with another what they might doe to Iesus.
\p
\v 12 And it came to passe in those dayes, that hee went out into a mountaine to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And when it was day, he called vnto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelue; whom also hee named Apostles:
\p
\v 14 Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother: Iames and Iohn, Philip and Bartholomew,
\p
\v 15 Matthew and Thomas, Iames the sonne of Alpheus, and Simon, called Zelotes,
\p
\v 16 And Iudas the brother of Iames, and Iudas Iscariot, which also was the traitour.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And hee came downe with them, and stood in the plaine, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people, out of all Iudea and Hierusalem, and from the Sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to heare him, and to be healed of their diseases,
\p
\v 18 And they that were vexed with vncleane spirits: and they were healed.
\p
\v 19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went vertue out of him, and healed them all.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And hee lifted vp his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be yee poore: for yours is the kingdome of God.
\p
\v 21 Blessed are yee that hunger now: for yee shall be filled. Blessed are yee that weepe now, for yee shall laugh.
\p
\v 22 Blessed are yee when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shal reproach you, and cast out your name as euill, for the Sonne of mans sake.
\p
\v 23 Reioice yee in that day, and leape for ioy: for behold, your reward is great in heauen for in the like maner did their fathers vnto the Prophets.
\p
\v 24 But woe vnto you that are rich: for yee haue receiued your consolation.
\p
\v 25 Woe vnto you that are full: for yee shall hunger. Woe vnto you that laugh now: for yee shall mourne and weepe.
\p
\v 26 Woe vnto you when all men shall speake well of you: for so did their fathers to the false Prophets.
\p
\v 27 ¶ But I say vnto you which heare, Loue your enemies, doe good to them which hate you,
\p
\v 28 Blesse them that curse you, & pray for them which despitefully vse you.
\p
\v 29 And vnto him that smiteth thee on the one cheeke, offer also the other: and him that taketh away thy cloake, forbid not to take thy coat also.
\p
\v 30 Giue to euery man that asketh of thee, and of him that taketh away thy goods, aske them not againe.
\p
\v 31 And as yee would that men should doe to you, doe yee also to them likewise.
\p
\v 32 For if yee loue them which loue you, what thanke haue ye? for sinners also loue those that loue them.
\p
\v 33 And if ye doe good to them which doe good to you, What thanke haue ye? for sinners also doe euen the same.
\p
\v 34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receiue, What thanke haue ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receiue as much againe.
\p
\v 35 But loue yee your enemies, and doe good, and lend, hoping for nothing againe: and your reward shall bee great, and ye shalbe the children of the Highest: for hee is kinde vnto the vnthankfull, and to the euill.
\p
\v 36 Be ye therefore mercifull, as your Father also is mercifull.
\p
\v 37 Iudge not, and ye shall not bee iudged: condemne not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgiue, and ye shall be forgiuen.
\p
\v 38 Giue, and it shall bee giuen vnto you, good measure, preassed downe, and shaken together, and running ouer, shall men giue into your bosome: for with the same measure that ye mete withall, it shall bee measured to you againe.
\p
\v 39 And hee spake a parable vnto them, Can the blinde leade the blinde? Shall they not both fall into the ditch?
\p
\v 40 The disciple is not aboue his master: but euery one that is perfect shalbe as his master.
\p
\v 41 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, but perceiuest not the beame that is in thine owne eye?
\p
\v 42 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let mee pull out the mote that is in thine eye: when thou thy selfe beholdest not the beame that is in thine owne eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beame out of thine owne eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pul out the mote that is in thy brothers eye.
\p
\v 43 For a good tree bringeth not foorth corrupt fruit: neither doeth a corrupt tree bring foorth good fruit.
\p
\v 44 For euery tree is knowen by his owne fruit: for of thornes men doe not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
\p
\v 45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth foorth that which is good: and an euill man out of the euill treasure of his heart, bringeth foorth that which is euill: For of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaketh.
\p
\v 46 ¶ And why call ye mee Lord, Lord, and doe not the things which I say?
\p
\v 47 Whosoeuer commeth to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like.
\p
\v 48 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deepe, and layd the foundation on a rocke. And when the flood arose, the streame beat vehemently vpon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded vpon a rocke.
\p
\v 49 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house vpon the earth: against which the streame did beate vehemently, and immediatly it fell, and the ruine of that house was great.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 Now when hee had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, hee entred into Capernaum.
\p
\v 2 And a certaine Centurions seruant, who was deare vnto him, was sicke and ready to die.
\p
\v 3 And when he heard of Iesus, he sent vnto him the Elders of the Iewes, beseeching him that he would come and heale his seruant.
\p
\v 4 And when they came to Iesus, they besought him instantly, saying, that hee was worthy for whome hee should doe this.
\p
\v 5 For he loueth our nation, and hee hath built vs a Synagogue.
\p
\v 6 Then Iesus went with them. And when he was now not farre from the house, the Centurion sent friends to him, saying vnto him, Lord, trouble not thy selfe: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter vnder my roofe.
\p
\v 7 Wherefore neither thought I my selfe worthy to come vnto thee: but say in a worde, and my seruant shall bee healed.
\p
\v 8 For I also am a man set vnder authoritie, hauing vnder mee souldiers: and I say vnto one, Goe, and he goeth: and to another, Come, and hee commeth: and to my seruant, Doe this, and he doeth it.
\p
\v 9 When Iesus heard these things, hee marueiled at him, and turned him about, and saide vnto the people that followed him, I say vnto you, I haue not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
\p
\v 10 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the seruant whole that had bene sicke.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And it came to passe the day after, that he went into a citie called Naim: and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.
\p
\v 12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the citie, behold, there was a dead man caried out, the onely sonne of his mother, and shee was a widow: and much people of the citie was with her.
\p
\v 13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and saide vnto her, Weepe not.
\p
\v 14 And hee came and touched the beere (and they that bare him, stood still.) And he said, Yong man, I say vnto thee, Arise.
\p
\v 15 And he that was dead, sate vp, and began to speake: and he deliuered him to his mother.
\p
\v 16 And there came a feare on all, and they glorified God, saying, that a great Prophet is risen vp among vs, and that God hath visited his people.
\p
\v 17 And this rumour of him went foorth throughout all Iudea, and throughout all the region round about.
\p
\v 18 And the disciples of Iohn shewed him of all these things.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And Iohn calling vnto him two of his disciples, sent them to Iesus, saying, Art thou hee that should come, or looke we for another?
\p
\v 20 When the men were come vnto him, they said, Iohn Baptist hath sent vs vnto thee, saying, Art thou hee that should come, or looke we for another?
\p
\v 21 And in that same houre hee cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of euill spirits, and vnto many that were blind, he gaue sight.
\p
\v 22 Then Iesus answering, said vnto them, Go your way, and tell Iohn what things ye haue seene and heard, how that the blind see, the lame walke, the lepers are clensed, the deafe heare, the dead are raised, to the poore the Gospel is preached.
\p
\v 23 And blessed is he whosoeuer shall not be offended in me.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And when the messengers of Iohn were departed, hee beganne to speake vnto &thorn;e people concerning Iohn: What went ye out into the wildernesse for to see? A reede shaken with the winde?
\p
\v 25 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and liue delicately, are in kings courts.
\p
\v 26 But what went ye out for to see? A Prophet? Yea, I say vnto you, and much more then a Prophet.
\p
\v 27 This is he of whome it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
\p
\v 28 For I say vnto you, among those that are borne of women, there is not a greater Prophet then Iohn the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdome of God, is greater then he.
\p
\v 29 And all the people that heard him, and the Publicanes, iustified God, being baptized with the baptisme of Iohn.
\p
\v 30 But the Pharisees and Lawyers reiected the counsell of God against themselues, being not baptized of him.
\p
\v 31 ¶ And the Lord said, whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?
\p
\v 32 They are like vnto children sitting in the market place, & calling one to another, and saying, We haue piped vnto you, and ye haue not danced: wee haue mourned to you, and yee haue not wept.
\p
\v 33 For Iohn the Baptist came, neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and ye say, He hath a deuill.
\p
\v 34 The sonne of man is come, eating, and drinking, and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a wine bibber, a friend of Publicanes and sinners.
\p
\v 35 But wisedome is iustified of all her children.
\p
\v 36 ¶ And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisees house, and sate downe to meat.
\p
\v 37 And behold, a woman in the citie which was a sinner, when shee knew that Iesus sate at meat in the Pharisees house, brought an Alabaster boxe of ointment,
\p
\v 38 And stood at his feet behind him, weeping, and began to wash his feete with teares, and did wipe them with the haires of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the oyntment.
\p
\v 39 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him, saw it, he spake within himselfe, saying, This man, if he were a Prophet, would haue knowen who, and what maner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.
\p
\v 40 And Iesus answering, said vnto him, Simon, I haue somewhat to say vnto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.
\p
\v 41 There was a certaine creditour, which had two debtors: the one ought fiue hundred pence, and the other fiftie.
\p
\v 42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgaue them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will loue him most?
\p
\v 43 Simon answered, and saide, I suppose, that hee to whome he forgaue most. And he said vnto him, Thou hast rightly iudged.
\p
\v 44 And hee turned to the woman, and said vnto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entred into thine house, thou gauest me no water for my feete: but shee hath washed my feete with teares, and wiped them with the haires of her head.
\p
\v 45 Thou gauest me no kisse: but this woman, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kisse my feet.
\p
\v 46 Mine head with oile thou didst not anoint: but this woman anointed my feet with oyntment.
\p
\v 47 Wherefore, I say vnto thee, her sinnes, which are many, are forgiuen, for she loued much: but to whom litle is forgiuen, the same loueth litle.
\p
\v 48 And he said vnto her, Thy sinnes are forgiuen.
\p
\v 49 And they that sate at meat with him, began to say within themselues, Who is this that forgiueth sinnes also?
\p
\v 50 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saued thee, goe in peace.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe afterward, &thorn;t he went throughout euery citie and village preaching, and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdome of God: and the twelue were with him,
\p
\v 2 And certaine women which had bene healed of euill spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene out of whom went seuen deuils,
\p
\v 3 And Ioanna the wife of Chuza, Herods steward, and Susanna, and many others which ministred vnto him of their substance.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of euery citie, he spake by a parable:
\p
\v 5 A Sower went out to sowe his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the wayes side, and it was troden downe, and the foules of the aire deuoured it.
\p
\v 6 And some fell vpon a rocke, and assoone as it was sprung vp, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.
\p
\v 7 And some fell among thornes, and the thornes sprang vp with it, and choked it.
\p
\v 8 And other fell on good ground, and sprang vp, and bare fruite an hundred fold. And when hee saide these things, he cryed, He that hath eares to heare, let him heare.
\p
\v 9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
\p
\v 10 And he said, Unto you it is giuen to know the mysteries of the kingdome of God: but to others in parables, that seeing, they might not see, and hearing, they might not vnderstand.
\p
\v 11 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
\p
\v 12 Those by the way side, are they that heare: then commeth the deuil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, least they should beleeue, and be saued.
\p
\v 13 They on the rocke, are they which when they heare, receiue the word with ioy; and these haue no roote, which for a while beleeue, and in time of temptation fall away.
\p
\v 14 And that which fell among thornes, are they, which when they haue heard, goe forth, and are choked with cares and riches, and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruite to perfection.
\p
\v 15 But that on the good ground, are they, which in an honest and good heart hauing heard the word, keepe it, and bring foorth fruite with patience.
\p
\v 16 ¶ No man when he hath lighted a candle, couereth it with a vessell, or putteth it vnder a bed: but setteth it on a candlesticke, that they which enter in, may see the light.
\p
\v 17 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest: neither any thing hid, that shall not be knowen, and come abroad.
\p
\v 18 Take heede therefore how yee heare: for whosoeuer hath, to him shall bee giuen; and whosoeuer hath not, from him shall be taken, euen that which he seemeth to haue.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the prease.
\p
\v 20 And it was told him by certaine which saide, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.
\p
\v 21 And hee answered and said vnto them, My mother and my brethren are these which heare the word of God, and doe it.
\p
\v 22 ¶ Now it came to passe on a certaine day, that he went into a ship, with his disciples: and hee said vnto them, Let vs goe ouer vnto the other side of the lake, and they lanched foorth.
\p
\v 23 But as they sailed, he fell asleepe, and there came downe a storme of wind on the lake, and they were filled with water, and were in ieopardie.
\p
\v 24 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he rose, and rebuked the wind, and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calme.
\p
\v 25 And he saide vnto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraide wondred, saying one to another, What maner of man is this? For he commandeth euen the winds and water, and they obey him.
\p
\v 26 ¶ And they arriued at the countrey of the Gadarenes, which is ouer against Galilee.
\p
\v 27 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the citie a certaine man which had deuils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombes.
\p
\v 28 When he saw Iesus, he cried out, and fell downe before him, and with a loud voyce said, What haue I to doe with thee, Iesus, thou sonne of God most high? I beseech thee torment me not.
\p
\v 29 (For he had commanded the vncleane spirit to come out of the man: For oftentimes it had caught him, and he was kept bound with chaines, and in fetters: and he brake the bands, and was driuen of the deuil into the wildernesse.)
\p
\v 30 And Iesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many deuils were entred into him.
\p
\v 31 And they besought him, that he would not command them to goe out into the deepe.
\p
\v 32 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountaine: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them: and he suffered them.
\p
\v 33 Then went the deuils out of the man, and entred into the swine: and the herd ran violently downe a steepe place into the lake, and were choked.
\p
\v 34 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went, and tolde it in the citie, and in the countrey.
\p
\v 35 Then they went out to see what was done, and came to Iesus, and found the man, out of whom the deuils were departed, sitting at the feete of Iesus, clothed, and in his right minde: and they were afraid.
\p
\v 36 They also which saw it, told them by what meanes he that was possessed of the deuils, was healed.
\p
\v 37 ¶ Then the whole multitude of the countrey of the Gadarenes round about, besought him to depart from them, for they were taken with great feare: and he went vp into the ship, and returned back againe.
\p
\v 38 Now the man, out of whom the deuils were departed, besought him that he might be with him: but Iesus sent him away, saying,
\p
\v 39 Returne to thine owne house, and shew how great things God hath done vnto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole citie how great things Iesus had done vnto him.
\p
\v 40 And it came to passe, that when Iesus was returned, the people gladly receiued him: for they were all waiting for him.
\p
\v 41 ¶ And behold, there came a man named Iairus, and hee was a ruler of the Synagogue, and hee fell downe at Iesus feete, and besought him that hee would come into his house:
\p
\v 42 For hee had one onely daughter about twelue yeeres of age, and she lay a dying. (But as hee went the people thronged him.
\p
\v 43 ¶ And a woman hauing an issue of blood twelue yeres, which had spent all her liuing vpon Phisitions, neither could be healed of any,
\p
\v 44 Came behinde him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediatly her issue of blood stanched.
\p
\v 45 And Iesus saide, Who touched mee? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him, said, Master, the multitude throng thee, and preasse thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
\p
\v 46 And Iesus saide, Some body hath touched mee: for I perceiue that vertue is gone out of me.
\p
\v 47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, shee came trembling, and falling downe before him, shee declared vnto him before all the people, for what cause shee had touched him, and how she was healed immediatly.
\p
\v 48 And he said vnto her, Daughter, be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole, goe in peace.)
\p
\v 49 ¶ While hee yet spake, there commeth one from the ruler of the Synagogues house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead, trouble not the Master.
\p
\v 50 But when Iesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Feare not, beleeue onely, and she shalbe made whole.
\p
\v 51 And when hee came into the house, hee suffered no man to goe in, saue Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and the father and the mother of the mayden.
\p
\v 52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weepe not, she is not dead, but sleepeth.
\p
\v 53 And they laughed him to scorne, knowing that she was dead.
\p
\v 54 And hee put them all out, and tooke her by the hand, and called, saying, Mayd, arise.
\p
\v 55 And her spirit came againe, and shee arose straightway: and hee commanded to giue her meat.
\p
\v 56 And her parents were astonished: but hee charged them that they should tell no man what was done.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 Then he called his twelue disciples together, and gaue them power and authority ouer all deuils, and to cure diseases.
\p
\v 2 And hee sent them to preach the Kingdome of God, and to heale the sicke.
\p
\v 3 And he said vnto them, Take nothing for your iourney, neither staues, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money, neither haue two coates apeece.
\p
\v 4 And whatsoeuer house yee enter into, there abide, and thence depart.
\p
\v 5 And whosoeuer will not receiue you, when ye goe out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feete, for a testimonie against them.
\p
\v 6 And they departed, and went through the townes, preaching the Gospel, and healing euery where.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Now Herode the Tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and hee was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that Iohn was risen from the dead:
\p
\v 8 And of some, that Elias had appeared: and of others, that one of the olde Prophets was risen againe.
\p
\v 9 And Herode said, Iohn haue I beheaded: but who is this of whom I heare such things? And hee desired to see him.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the Apostles when they were returned, tolde him all that they had done. And hee tooke them, and went aside priuately into a desert place, belonging to the citie called Bethsaida.
\p
\v 11 And the people when they knew it, followed him, and he receiued them, and spake vnto them of the kingdome of God, and healed them that had need of healing.
\p
\v 12 And when the day beganne to weare away, then came the twelue, and said vnto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the townes and countrey round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.
\p
\v 13 But he said vnto them, Giue yee them to eate. And they said, Wee haue no more but fiue loaues and two fishes, except we should goe and buy meate for all this people.
\p
\v 14 For they were about fiue thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit downe by fifties in a company.
\p
\v 15 And they did so, and made them all sit downe.
\p
\v 16 Then he tooke the fiue loaues and the two fishes, and looking vp to heauen, hee blessed them, and brake, and gaue to the disciples to set before the multitude.
\p
\v 17 And they did eate, and were all filled. And there was taken vp of fragments that remained to them, twelue baskets.
\p
\v 18 ¶ And it came to passe, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?
\p
\v 19 They answering, said, Iohn the Baptist: but some say, Elias: and others say, that one of the old Prophets is risen againe.
\p
\v 20 He said vnto them, But whom say yee that I am? Peter answering, said, The Christ of God.
\p
\v 21 And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing,
\p
\v 22 Saying, The Sonne of man must suffer many things, and be reiected of the Elders, and chiefe Priests, and Scribes, and be slaine, and be raised the third day.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him denie himselfe, and take vp his crosse daily, and follow me.
\p
\v 24 For whosoeuer will saue his life, shall lose it: but whosoeuer will lose his life for my sake, the same shall saue it.
\p
\v 25 For what is a man aduantaged, if hee gaine the whole world, and lose himselfe, or be cast away?
\p
\v 26 For whosoeuer shall bee ashamed of me, and of my wordes, of him shall the Sonne of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his owne glory, and in his Fathers, and of the holy Angels.
\p
\v 27 But I tell you of a trueth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdome of God.
\p
\v 28 ¶ And it came to passe, about an eight dayes after these sayings, hee tooke Peter, and Iohn, and Iames, and went vp into a mountaine to pray:
\p
\v 29 And as hee prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.
\p
\v 30 And behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias,
\p
\v 31 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease, which he should accomplish at Hierusalem.
\p
\v 32 But Peter, and they that were with him, were heauie with sleepe: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
\p
\v 33 And it came to passe, as they departed from him, Peter said vnto Iesus, Master, it is good for vs to be here, and let vs make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.
\p
\v 34 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and ouershadowed them, & they feared, as they entred into the cloude.
\p
\v 35 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloued Son, heare him.
\p
\v 36 And when the voyce was past, Iesus was found alone, and they kept it close, & told no man in those dayes any of those things which they had seene.
\p
\v 37 ¶ And it came to passe, that on the next day, when they were come downe from the hill, much people met him.
\p
\v 38 And behold, a man of the companie cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee looke vpon my sonne, for he is mine onely child.
\p
\v 39 And loe, a spirit taketh him, and hee suddenly crieth out, and it teareth him that he fometh againe, and bruising him, hardly departeth from him.
\p
\v 40 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.
\p
\v 41 And Iesus answering, said, O faithlesse, and peruerse generation, how long shal I be with you, and suffer you? bring thy sonne hither.
\p
\v 42 And as he was yet a comming, the deuill threw him downe, and tare him: and Iesus rebuked the vncleane spirit, and healed the child, and deliuered him againe to his father.
\p
\v 43 ¶ And they were al amazed at the mightie power of God: But while they wondred euery one at all things which Iesus did, he said vnto his disciples,
\p
\v 44 Let these sayings sinke downe into your eares: for the Sonne of man shall bee deliuered into the handes of men.
\p
\v 45 But they vnderstood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceiued it not: and they feared to aske him of that saying.
\p
\v 46 ¶ Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.
\p
\v 47 And Iesus perceiuing &thorn;e thought of their heart, tooke a child, and set him by him,
\p
\v 48 And said vnto them, Whosoeuer shall receiue this child in my Name, receiueth me: and whosoeuer shal receiue me, receiueth him that sent me: For hee that is least among you all, the same shalbe great.
\p
\v 49 ¶ And Iohn answered, and said, Master, we saw one casting out deuils in thy Name, and we forbade him, because he followeth not with vs.
\p
\v 50 And Iesus said vnto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against vs, is for vs.
\p
\v 51 ¶ And it came to passe, when the time was come that he should bee receiued vp, he stedfastly set his face to goe to Hierusalem,
\p
\v 52 And sent messengers before his face, and they went and entred into a village of the Samaritanes to make ready for him.
\p
\v 53 And they did not receiue him, because his face was as though he would goe to Hierusalem.
\p
\v 54 And when his disciples, Iames and Iohn sawe this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that wee command fire to come downe from heauen, and consume them, euen as Elias did?
\p
\v 55 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what maner spirit ye are of.
\p
\v 56 For the Sonne of man is not come to destroy mens liues, but to saue them. And they went to another village.
\p
\v 57 ¶ And it came to passe that as they went in the way, a certaine man said vnto him, Lord, I wil follow thee whithersoeuer thou goest.
\p
\v 58 And Iesus said vnto him, Foxes haue holes, and birds of the aire haue nests, but the Sonne of man hath not where to lay his head.
\p
\v 59 And he said vnto another, Follow me: But he said, Lord, suffer mee first to goe and bury my father.
\p
\v 60 Iesus said vnto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdome of God.
\p
\v 61 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee: but let me first goe bid them farewel, which are at home at my house.
\p
\v 62 And Iesus said vnto him, No man hauing put his hand to the plough, and looking backe, is fit for the kingdome of God.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 After these things, the Lord appointed other seuenty also, and sent them two and two before his face, into euery citie and place, whither hee himselfe would come.
\p
\v 2 Therefore said hee vnto them, The haruest truly is great, but the labourers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the haruest, that he would send foorth labourers into his haruest.
\p
\v 3 Go your wayes: Behold, I send you forth as lambes among wolues.
\p
\v 4 Cary neither purse nor scrip, nor shoes, and salute no man by the way.
\p
\v 5 And into whatsoeuer house yee enter, first say, Peace bee to this house.
\p
\v 6 And if the sonne of peace be there, your peace shall rest vpon it: if not, it shall turne to you againe.
\p
\v 7 And in the same house remaine, eating and drinking such things as they giue: For the labourer is worthy of his hire. Goe not from house to house.
\p
\v 8 And into whatsoeuer citie yee enter, and they receiue you, eate such things as are set before you:
\p
\v 9 And heale the sicke that are therein, and say vnto them, The kingdome of God is come nigh vnto you.
\p
\v 10 But into whatsoeuer citie yee enter, and they receiue you not, goe your waies out into the streetes of the same, and say,
\p
\v 11 Euen the very dust of your citie which cleaueth on vs, we doe wipe off against you: notwithstanding, be yee sure of this, that the kingdome of God is come nigh vnto you.
\p
\v 12 But I say vnto you, That it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodome, then for that citie.
\p
\v 13 Woe vnto thee Chorazin, wo vnto thee Bethsaida: For if the mighty workes had beene done in Tyre and Sidon, which haue beene done in you, they had a great while agoe repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
\p
\v 14 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the iudgment, then for you.
\p
\v 15 And thou Capernaum, which art exalted to heauen, shalt be thrust downe to hell.
\p
\v 16 Hee that heareth you, heareth me: and he that despiseth you, despiseth me: and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And the seuenty returned againe with ioy, saying, Lord, euen the deuils are subiect vnto vs through thy name.
\p
\v 18 And he said vnto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heauen.
\p
\v 19 Behold, I giue vnto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and ouer all the power of the enemie: and nothing shall by any meanes hurt you.
\p
\v 20 Notwithstanding in this reioyce not, that the spirits are subiect vnto you: but rather reioyce, because your names are written in heauen.
\p
\v 21 ¶ In that houre Iesus reioyced in spirit, and said, I thanke thee, O father, Lord of heauen and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast reuealed them vnto babes: euen so father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.
\p
\v 22 All things are deliuered to me of my father: and no man knoweth who the sonne is, but the father: and who the father is, but the sonne, and he to whom the sonne will reueale him.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And he turned him vnto his disciples, and said priuately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that yee see.
\p
\v 24 For I tell you, that many Prophets, and kings haue desired to see those things which yee see, and haue not seene them: & to heare those things which yee heare, and haue not heard them.
\p
\v 25 ¶ And behold, a certaine Lawyer stood vp, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I doe to inherite eternall life? He said vnto him,
\p
\v 26 What is written in the law? how readest thou?
\p
\v 27 And he answering, said, Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy strength, and with all thy minde, and thy neighbour as thy selfe.
\p
\v 28 And he said vnto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt liue.
\p
\v 29 But he willing to iustifie himselfe, said vnto Iesus, And who is my neighbour?
\p
\v 30 And Iesus answering, said, A certaine man went downe from Hierusalem to Iericho, and fel among theeues, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leauing him halfe dead.
\p
\v 31 And by chaunce there came downe a certaine Priest that way, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
\p
\v 32 And likewise a Leuite, when hee was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.
\p
\v 33 But a certaine Samaritane as he iourneyed, came where he was; and when hee saw him, hee had compassion on him,
\p
\v 34 And went to him, and bound vp his wounds, powring in oile and wine, and set him on his owne beast, and brought him to an Inne, and tooke care of him.
\p
\v 35 And on the morrow when he departed, hee tooke out two pence, and gaue them to the hoste, and saide vnto him, Take care of him, and whatsoeuer thou spendest more, when I come againe I will repay thee.
\p
\v 36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour vnto him that fell among the theeues?
\p
\v 37 And he said, He that shewed mercie on him. Then said Iesus vnto him, Goe, and doe thou likewise.
\p
\v 38 ¶ Now it came to passe, as they went, that he entred into a certaine village: and a certaine woman named Martha, receiued him into her house.
\p
\v 39 And shee had a sister called Mary, which also sate at Iesus feet, and heard his word:
\p
\v 40 But Martha was cumbred about much seruing, and came to him, and said, Lord, doest thou not care that my sister hath left mee to serue alone? Bid her therefore that she helpe me.
\p
\v 41 And Iesus answered, and saide vnto her, Martha, Martha, thou art carefull, and troubled about many things:
\p
\v 42 But one thing is needefull, and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not bee taken away from her.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe, that as he was praying in a certaine place, when hee ceased, one of his disciples said vnto him, Lord, teach vs to pray, as Iohn also taught his disciples.
\p
\v 2 And hee said vnto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heauen, Halowed be thy Name, Thy kingdome come, Thy will be done as in heauen, so in earth.
\p
\v 3 Giue vs day by day our dayly bread.
\p
\v 4 And forgiue vs our sinnes: for we also forgiue euery one that is indebted to vs. And lead vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill.
\p
\v 5 And he said vnto them, Which of you shall haue a friend, and shall goe vnto him at midnight, and say vnto him, Friend, lend me three loaues.
\p
\v 6 For a friend of mine in his iourney is come to me, and I haue nothing to set before him,
\p
\v 7 And he from within shal answere and say, Trouble mee not, the doore is now shut, and my children are with me in bed: I cannot rise and giue thee.
\p
\v 8 I say vnto you, Though he will not rise, and giue him, because he is his friend: yet because of his importunitie, hee will rise and giue him as many as he needeth.
\p
\v 9 And I say vnto you, Aske, and it shalbe giuen you: seeke, and ye shal find: knocke, and it shalbe opened vnto you.
\p
\v 10 For euery one that asketh, receiueth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shalbe opened.
\p
\v 11 If a sonne shall aske bread of any of you that is a father, will hee giue him a stone? Or if he aske a fish, will he for a fish giue him a serpent?
\p
\v 12 Or if he shall aske an egge, will he offer him a scorpion?
\p
\v 13 If ye then, being euill, know how to giue good gifts vnto your children: how much more shall your heauenly Father giue the holy Spirit to them that aske him?
\p
\v 14 ¶ And he was casting out a deuil, and it was dumbe. And it came to passe, when the deuill was gone out, the dumbe spake: and the people wondred.
\p
\v 15 But some of them said, Hee casteth out deuils through Beelzebub the chiefe of the deuils.
\p
\v 16 And other tempting him, sought of him a signe from heauen.
\p
\v 17 But he knowing their thoughts, said vnto them, Euery kingdome diuided against it selfe, is brought to desolation: and a house diuided against a house, falleth.
\p
\v 18 If Satan also be diuided against himselfe, how shall his kingdom stand? Because yee say that I cast out deuils through Beelzebub.
\p
\v 19 And if I by Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whom doe your sonnes cast them out? therefore shall they be your iudges.
\p
\v 20 But if I with the finger of God cast out deuils, no doubt the kingdome of God is come vpon you.
\p
\v 21 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:
\p
\v 22 But when a stronger then he shal come vpon him, and ouercome him, hee taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and diuideth his spoiles.
\p
\v 23 He that is not with me, is against me: and hee that gathereth not with me, scattereth.
\p
\v 24 When the vncleane spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through drie places, seeking rest: and finding none, he sayth, I will returne vnto my house whence I came out.
\p
\v 25 And when hee commeth, hee findeth it swept and garnished.
\p
\v 26 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seuen other spirits more wicked then himselfe, and they enter in, and dwell there, and the last state of that man is worse then the first.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And it came to passe as hee spake these things, a certaine woman of the company lift vp her voice, and said vnto him, Blessed is the wombe that bare thee, and the pappes which thou hast sucked.
\p
\v 28 But hee said, Yea, rather blessed are they that heare the word of God, and keepe it.
\p
\v 29 ¶ And when the people were gathered thicke together, hee began to say, This is an euill generation, they seeke a signe, and there shall no signe be giuen it, but the signe of Ionas the Prophet:
\p
\v 30 For as Ionas was a signe vnto the Nineuites, so shall also the Sonne of man be to this generation.
\p
\v 31 The Queene of the South shall rise vp in the iudgement with the men of this generation, & condemne them: for shee came from the vtmost parts of the earth, to heare the wisedome of Solomon: and behold, a greater then Solomon is here.
\p
\v 32 The men of Nineue shall rise vp in the iudgement with this generation, and shall condemne it: for they repented at the preaching of Ionas, and behold, a greater then Ionas is here.
\p
\v 33 No man when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither vnder a bushell, but on a candlesticke, that they which come in may see the light.
\p
\v 34 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light: but when thine eye is euill, thy body also is full of darkenesse.
\p
\v 35 Take heede therefore, that the light which is in thee, be not darknesse.
\p
\v 36 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, hauing no part darke, the whole shalbe full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doeth giue thee light.
\p
\v 37 ¶ And as he spake, a certaine Pharise besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sate downe to meate.
\p
\v 38 And when the Pharise saw it, he marueiled that he had not first washed before dinner.
\p
\v 39 And the Lord said vnto him, Now doe ye Pharises make cleane the outside of the cup and the platter: but your inward part is full of rauening and wickednesse.
\p
\v 40 Yee fooles, did not he that made that which is without, make that which is within also?
\p
\v 41 But rather giue almes of such things as you haue: and behold, all things are cleane vnto you.
\p
\v 42 But woe vnto you Pharises: for ye tythe Mint and Rue, and all maner of herbes, and passe ouer iudgement, and the loue of God: these ought yee to haue done, and not to leaue the other vndone.
\p
\v 43 Woe vnto you Pharisees: for ye loue the vppermost seats in the Synagogues, and greetings in the markets.
\p
\v 44 Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: for ye are as graues which appeare not, and the men that walk ouer them, are not aware of them.
\p
\v 45 ¶ Then answered one of the Lawyers, and said vnto him, Master, thus saying, thou reprochest vs also.
\p
\v 46 And he said, Woe vnto you also ye lawyers: for ye lade men with burdens grieuous to be borne, and ye your selues touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
\p
\v 47 Woe vnto you: for ye build the sepulchres of the Prophets, and your fathers killed them.
\p
\v 48 Truely ye beare witnesse that ye allowe the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and yee build their sepulchres.
\p
\v 49 Therefore also said the wisedome of God, I wil send them Prophets and Apostles, and some of them they shal slay and persecute:
\p
\v 50 That the blood of all the Prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation,
\p
\v 51 From the blood of Abel vnto the blood of Zacharias, which perished betweene the Altar and the Temple: Uerely I say vnto you, it shall be required of this generation.
\p
\v 52 Woe vnto you Lawyers: for ye haue taken away the key of knowledge: ye entred not in your selues, and them that were entring in, ye hindred.
\p
\v 53 And as he said these things vnto them, the Scribes and the Pharisees began to vrge him vehemently, and to prouoke him to speake of many things:
\p
\v 54 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 In the meane time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one vpon another, he began to say vnto his disciples first of all, Beware yee of the leauen of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisie.
\p
\v 2 For there is nothing couered, that shall not be reuealed, neither hid, that shall not be knowen.
\p
\v 3 Therefore, whatsoeuer yee haue spoken in darkenesse, shall bee heard in the light: and that which yee haue spoken in the eare, in closets, shal be proclaimed vpon the house tops.
\p
\v 4 And I say vnto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that, haue no more that they can doe.
\p
\v 5 But I will forewarne you whom you shall feare: Feare him, which after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell, yea, I say vnto you, Feare him.
\p
\v 6 Are not fiue sparrowes solde for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?
\p
\v 7 But euen the very haires of your head are all numbred: Feare not therefore, ye are of more value then many sparrowes.
\p
\v 8 Also I say vnto you, Whosoeuer shall confesse me before men, him shall the Sonne of man also confesse before the Angels of God.
\p
\v 9 But he that denieth me before men, shalbe denied before the Angels of God.
\p
\v 10 And whosoeuer shall speake a word against the Sonne of man, it shall be forgiuen him: but vnto him that blasphemeth against the holy Ghost, it shal not be forgiuen.
\p
\v 11 And when they bring you vnto the Synagogues, and vnto Magistrates, & powers, take yee no thought how or what thing ye shall answere, or what ye shall say:
\p
\v 12 For the holy Ghost shal teach you in the same houre, what ye ought to say.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And one of the company saide vnto him, Master, speake to my brother, that he diuide the inheritance with me.
\p
\v 14 And he said vnto him, Man, who made mee a iudge, or a diuider ouer you?
\p
\v 15 And he said vnto them, Take heed and beware of couetousnes: for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
\p
\v 16 And he spake a parable vnto them, saying, The ground of a certaine rich man brought foorth plentifully.
\p
\v 17 And he thought within himselfe, saying, What shall I doe, because I haue no roome where to bestow my fruits?
\p
\v 18 And he said, This will I doe, I will pull downe my barnes, and build greater, and there will I bestow all my fruits, and my goods.
\p
\v 19 And I will say to my soule, Soule, thou hast much goods layd vp for many yeeres, take thine ease, eate, drinke, and be merry.
\p
\v 20 But God said vnto him, Thou foole, this night thy soule shal be required of thee: then whose shal those things be which thou hast prouided?
\p
\v 21 So is he that laieth vp treasure for himselfe, and is not rich towards God.
\p
\v 22 ¶ And he said vnto his disciples, Therefore I say vnto you, Take no thought for your life what yee shall eate, neither for the body what yee shall put on.
\p
\v 23 The life is more then meate, and the body is more then raiment.
\p
\v 24 Consider the rauens, for they neither sow nor reape, which neither haue storehouse nor barne, and God feedeth them: How much more are yee better then the foules?
\p
\v 25 And which of you with taking thought can adde to his stature one cubite?
\p
\v 26 If yee then bee not able to doe that thing which is least, why take yee thought for the rest?
\p
\v 27 Consider the Lillies how they growe, they toile not; they spinne not: and yet I say vnto you, that Solomon in all his glory, was not arayed like one of these.
\p
\v 28 If then God so clothe the grasse, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the ouen: how much more will he clothe you, O ye of litle faith?
\p
\v 29 And seeke not yee what yee shall eate, or what ye shall drinke, neither be ye of doubtfull minde.
\p
\v 30 For all these things doe the nations of the world seeke after: and your father knoweth that yee haue neede of these things.
\p
\v 31 ¶ But rather seeke yee the kingdome of God, and all these things shall be added vnto you.
\p
\v 32 Feare not, litle flocke, for it is your fathers good pleasure to giue you the kingdome.
\p
\v 33 Sell that yee haue, and giue almes: prouide your selues bagges which waxe not old, a treasure in the heauens that faileth not, where no theefe approcheth, neither moth corrupteth.
\p
\v 34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
\p
\v 35 Let your loines be girded about, and your lights burning,
\p
\v 36 And ye your selues like vnto men that waite for their Lord, when he will returne from the wedding, that when he commeth and knocketh, they may open vnto him immediately.
\p
\v 37 Blessed are those seruants, whom the Lord when he commeth, shall find watching: Uerily, I say vnto you, That he shall girde himselfe, and make them to sit downe to meate, and will come foorth and serue them.
\p
\v 38 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those seruants.
\p
\v 39 And this know, that if the good man of the house had knowen what houre the theefe would come, he would haue watched, and not haue suffred his house to be broken thorow.
\p
\v 40 Be yee therefore ready also: for the sonne of man commeth at an houre when yee thinke not.
\p
\v 41 ¶ Then Peter said vnto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable vnto vs, or euen to all?
\p
\v 42 And the Lord said, Who then is that faithfull and wise steward, whom his Lord shall make ruler ouer his houshold, to giue them their portion of meate in due season?
\p
\v 43 Blessed is that seruant, whom his Lord when he commeth, shall find so doing.
\p
\v 44 Of a trueth, I say vnto you, that hee will make him ruler ouer all that he hath.
\p
\v 45 But and if that seruant say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his comming and shall beginne to beat the men seruants, and maidens, and to eate and drinke, and to be drunken:
\p
\v 46 The Lord of that seruant will come in a day when hee looketh not for him, and at an houre when hee is not ware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the vnbeleeuers.
\p
\v 47 And that seruant which knew his Lords will, and prepared not himselfe, neither did according to his will, shalbe beaten with many stripes.
\p
\v 48 But hee that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall bee beaten with few stripes. For vnto whomsoeuer much is giuen, of him shal bee much required: and to whom men haue committed much, of him they will aske the more.
\p
\v 49 ¶ I am come to send fire on the earth, and what will I, if it be already kindled?
\p
\v 50 But I haue a baptisme to be baptized with, and how am I straitned till it be accomplished?
\p
\v 51 Suppose yee that I am come to giue peace on earth? I tell you, Nay, but rather diuision.
\p
\v 52 For from henceforth there shalbe fiue in one house diuided, three against two, and two against three.
\p
\v 53 The father shall bee diuided against the sonne, and the sonne against the father: the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother: the mother in lawe against her daughter in lawe, and the daughter in law against her mother in lawe.
\p
\v 54 ¶ And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the West, straightway yee say, There commeth a showre, and so it is.
\p
\v 55 And when ye see the Southwind blow, ye say, There will be heat, and it commeth to passe.
\p
\v 56 Ye hypocrites, ye can discerne the face of the skie, and of the earth: but how is it that yee doe not discerne this time?
\p
\v 57 Yea, and why euen of your selues iudge ye not what is right?
\p
\v 58 ¶ When thou goest with thine aduersary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, giue diligence that thou mayest be deliuered from him, lest hee hale thee to the Iudge, and the Iudge deliuer thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.
\p
\v 59 I tell thee, Thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast payd the very last mite.

\c 13
\p
\v 1 There were present at that season, some that told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
\p
\v 2 And Iesus answering, said vnto them, Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners aboue all the Galileans, because they suffered such things?
\p
\v 3 I tell you, Nay: but except yee repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
\p
\v 4 Or those eighteene, vpon whom the towre in Siloe fell, and slew them, thinke ye that they were sinners aboue all men that dwelt in Hierusalem?
\p
\v 5 I tell you, Nay; but except yee repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
\p
\v 6 ¶ Hee spake also this parable, A certaine man had a figtree planted in his Uineyard, and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.
\p
\v 7 Then said hee vnto the dresser of his Uineyard, Beholde, these three yeeres I come seeking fruit on this figtree, and finde none: cut it downe, why cumbreth it the ground?
\p
\v 8 And he answering, said vnto him, Lord, let it alone this yeere also, till I shall digge about it, and doung it:
\p
\v 9 And if it beare fruit, Well: and if not, then after that, thou shalt cut it downe.
\p
\v 10 And he was teaching in one of the Synagogues on the Sabbath.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And beholde, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmitie eighteene yeeres, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift vp her selfe.
\p
\v 12 And when Iesus saw her, he called her to him, and said vnto her, Woman, thou art loosed fr&#333; thy infirmitie.
\p
\v 13 And hee layd his handes on her, and immediatly she was made straight, and glorified God.
\p
\v 14 And the ruler of the Synagogue answered with indignation, because that Iesus had healed on the Sabbath day, and said vnto the people, There are sixe dayes in which men ought to worke: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.
\p
\v 15 The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doeth not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his oxe or his asse from the stall, and leade him away to watering?
\p
\v 16 And ought not this woman being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, loe these eighteene yeeres, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?
\p
\v 17 And when hee had said these things, all his aduersaries were ashamed: & all the people reioyced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
\p
\v 18 ¶ Then said he, Unto what is the kingdome of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?
\p
\v 19 It is like a graine of mustard seed, which a man tooke, and cast into his garden, and it grew, and waxed a great tree: and the foules of the aire lodged in the branches of it.
\p
\v 20 And againe hee said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdome of God?
\p
\v 21 It is like leauen, which a woman tooke and hidde in three measures of meale, till the whole was leauened.
\p
\v 22 And he went thorow the cities and villages, teaching and iourneying towards Hierusalem.
\p
\v 23 Then said one vnto him, Lord, are there few that be saued? And he said vnto them,
\p
\v 24 ¶ Striue to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say vnto you, will seeke to enter in, and shall not be able.
\p
\v 25 When once the master of the house is risen vp, & hath shut to the doore, and ye begin to stand without, & to knocke at the doore, saying, Lord, Lord, open vnto vs, and he shal answere, & say vnto you, I know you not whence you are:
\p
\v 26 Then shall ye begin to say, Wee haue eaten and drunke in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.
\p
\v 27 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence you are; depart from me all ye workers of iniquitie.
\p
\v 28 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when yee shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Iacob, and all the Prophets in the kingdome of God, and you your selues thrust out.
\p
\v 29 And they shall come from the East, and from the West, and from the North, and from the South, and shall sit downe in the kingdome of God.
\p
\v 30 And behold, there are last, which shall be first; and there are first, which shall be last.
\p
\v 31 ¶ The same day there came certaine of the Pharises, saying vnto him, Get thee out, and depart hence; for Herode will kill thee.
\p
\v 32 And he said vnto them, Go ye and tell that Foxe, behold, I cast out deuils, and I doe cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.
\p
\v 33 Neuerthelesse, I must walke to day and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a Prophet perish out of Hierusalem.
\p
\v 34 O Hierusalem, Hierusalem, which killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent vnto thee; how often would I haue gathered thy children together, as a henne doeth gather her brood vnder her wings, & ye would not?
\p
\v 35 Behold, your house is left vnto you desolate. And verely I say vnto you, ye shall not see me, vntill the time come when yee shall say, Blessed is hee that commeth in the Name of the Lord.

\c 14
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharises to eat bread on &thorn;e Sabbath day, that they watched him.
\p
\v 2 And behold, there was a certaine man before him, which had the dropsie.
\p
\v 3 And Iesus answering, spake vnto the Lawyers and Pharises, saying, Is it lawfull to heale on the Sabbath day?
\p
\v 4 And they held their peace. And he tooke him, and healed him, & let him go,
\p
\v 5 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall haue an asse or an oxe fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath day?
\p
\v 6 And they could not answere him againe to these things.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And he put foorth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked howe they chose out the chiefe roumes, saying vnto them,
\p
\v 8 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not downe in the highest roume: lest a more honourable man then thou be bidden of him,
\p
\v 9 And hee that bade thee and him, come, and say to thee, Giue this man place: and thou begin with shame to take the lowest roume.
\p
\v 10 But when thou art bidden, goe and sit downe in the lowest roume, that when he that bade thee commeth, hee may say vnto thee, Friend, goe vp higher: then shalt thou haue worship in the presence of them that sit at meate with thee.
\p
\v 11 For whosoeuer exalteth himselfe, shalbe abased: and hee that humbleth himselfe, shalbe exalted.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Then said hee also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsemen, nor thy rich neighbours, lest they also bid thee againe, and a recompence be made thee.
\p
\v 13 But when thou makest a feast, call the poore, the maimed, the lame, the blinde,
\p
\v 14 And thou shalt be blessed, for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the iust.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And when one of them that sate at meate with him, heard these things, he said vnto him, Blessed is hee that shall eate bread in the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 16 Then said hee vnto him, A certaine man made a great supper, and bade many:
\p
\v 17 And sent his seruant at supper time, to say to them that were bidden, Come, for all things are now ready.
\p
\v 18 And they all with one consent began to make excuse: The first said vnto him, I haue bought a piece of ground, and I must needs goe and see it: I pray thee haue me excused.
\p
\v 19 And another said, I haue bought fiue yoke of oxen, and I goe to prooue them: I pray thee haue me excused.
\p
\v 20 And another said, I haue maried a wife: and therefore I cannot come.
\p
\v 21 So that seruant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry, sayde to his seruant, Goe out quickely into the streetes and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poore, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blinde.
\p
\v 22 And the seruant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is roume.
\p
\v 23 And the Lord said vnto the seruant, Goe out into the high wayes and hedges, and compell them to come in, that my house may be filled.
\p
\v 24 For I say vnto you, that none of those men which were bidden, shall taste of my supper.
\p
\v 25 ¶ And there went great multitudes with him: and hee turned, and said vnto them,
\p
\v 26 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea and his owne life also, hee cannot be my disciple.
\p
\v 27 And whosoeuer doeth not beare his crosse, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.
\p
\v 28 For which of you intending to build a towre, sitteth not downe first, and counteth the cost, whether he haue sufficient to finish it?
\p
\v 29 Lest haply after hee hath laide the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it, begin to mock him,
\p
\v 30 Saying, This man beganne to build, and was not able to finish.
\p
\v 31 Or what king going to make war against another king, sitteth not downe first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand, to meete him that commeth against him with twentie thousand?
\p
\v 32 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, hee sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.
\p
\v 33 So likewise, whosoeuer he be of you, that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.
\p
\v 34 ¶ Salt is good: but if the salt haue lost his sauour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?
\p
\v 35 It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill: but men cast it out. He that hath eares to heare, let him heare.

\c 15
\p
\v 1 Then drew neere vnto him all the Publicanes and sinners, for to heare him.
\p
\v 2 And the Pharises and Scribes murmured, murmured, saying, This man receiueth sinners, and eateth with them.
\p
\v 3 ¶ And he spake this parable vnto them, saying,
\p
\v 4 What man of you hauing an hundred sheepe, if he loose one of them, doth not leaue the ninety and nine in the wildernesse, and goe after that which is lost, vntill he find it?
\p
\v 5 And when he hath found it, hee layeth it on his shoulders, reioycing.
\p
\v 6 And when he commeth home, he calleth together his friends, and neighbours, saying vnto them, Reioyce with me, for I haue found my sheepe which was lost.
\p
\v 7 I say vnto you, that likewise ioy shall be in heauen ouer one sinner that repenteth, more then ouer ninety and nine iust persons, which need no repentance.
\p
\v 8 ¶ Either what woman hauing ten pieces of siluer, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweepe the house, and seeke diligently till shee find it?
\p
\v 9 And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Reioyce with me, for I haue found &thorn;e piece which I had lost.
\p
\v 10 Likewise I say vnto you, there is ioy in the presence of the Angels of God, ouer one sinner that repenteth.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And hee said, A certaine man had two sonnes:
\p
\v 12 And the yonger of them said to his father, Father, giue me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he diuided vnto them his liuing.
\p
\v 13 And not many dayes after, the yonger sonne gathered al together, and tooke his iourney into a farre countrey, and there wasted his substance with riotous liuing.
\p
\v 14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land, and he beganne to be in want.
\p
\v 15 And he went and ioyned himselfe to a citizen of that countrey, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
\p
\v 16 And he would faine haue filled his belly with the huskes that the swine did eate: & no man gaue vnto him.
\p
\v 17 And when he came to himselfe, he said, How many hired seruants of my fathers haue bread inough and to spare, and I perish with hunger?
\p
\v 18 I will arise and goe to my father, and will say vnto him, Father, I haue sinned against heauen and before thee.
\p
\v 19 And am no more worthy to be called thy sonne: make me as one of thy hired seruants.
\p
\v 20 And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ranne, and fell on his necke, and kissed him.
\p
\v 21 And the sonne said vnto him, Father, I haue sinned against heauen, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy sonne.
\p
\v 22 But the father saide to his seruants, Bring foorth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shooes on his feete.
\p
\v 23 And bring hither the fatted calfe, and kill it, and let vs eate and be merrie.
\p
\v 24 For this my sonne was dead, and is aliue againe; hee was lost, & is found. And they began to be merie.
\p
\v 25 Now his elder sonne was in the field, and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musicke & dauncing,
\p
\v 26 And he called one of the seruants, and asked what these things meant.
\p
\v 27 And he said vnto him, Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calfe, because he hath receiued him safe and sound.
\p
\v 28 And he was angry, and would not goe in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.
\p
\v 29 And he answering said to his father, Loe, these many yeeres doe I serue thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandement, and yet thou neuer gauest mee a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
\p
\v 30 But as soone as this thy sonne was come, which hath deuoured thy liuing with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calfe.
\p
\v 31 And he said vnto him, Sonne, thou art euer with me, and all that I haue is thine.
\p
\v 32 It was meete that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is aliue againe: and was lost, and is found.

\c 16
\p
\v 1 And hee said also vnto his disciples, There was a certaine rich man which had a Steward, and the same was accused vnto him that he had wasted his goods.
\p
\v 2 And hee called him, and said vnto him, How is it that I heare this of thee? Giue an accompt of thy stewardship: for thou mayest bee no longer Steward.
\p
\v 3 Then the Steward said within himselfe, What shall I doe, for my lord taketh away from mee the Stewardship? I cannot digge, to begge I am ashamed.
\p
\v 4 I am resolued what to doe, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receiue me into their houses.
\p
\v 5 So hee called euery one of his lords detters vnto him, and said vnto the first, How much owest thou vnto my lord?
\p
\v 6 And hee said, An hundred measures of oyle. And hee saide vnto him, Take thy bill, and sit downe quickly, and write fiftie.
\p
\v 7 Then said hee to another, And how much owest thou? And hee said, An hundred measures of wheat. And hee saide vnto him, Take thy bill and write fourescore.
\p
\v 8 And the lord commended the vniust Steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser then the children of light.
\p
\v 9 And I say vnto you, Make to your selues friends of the Mammon of vnrighteousnesse, that when ye faile, they may receiue you into euerlasting habitations.
\p
\v 10 Hee that is faithfull in that which is least, is faithfull also in much: and he that is vniust in the least, is vniust also in much.
\p
\v 11 If therefore yee haue not bene faithfull in the vnrighteous Mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?
\p
\v 12 And if ye haue not bene faithful in that which is another mans, who shall giue you that which is your owne?
\p
\v 13 ¶ No seruant can serue two masters, for either he will hate the one, and loue the other: or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other: yee cannot serue God and Mammon.
\p
\v 14 And the Pharisees also who were couetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.
\p
\v 15 And he said vnto them, Ye are they which iustifie your selues before men, but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed amongst men, is abomination in the sight of God.
\p
\v 16 The law and the Prophets were vntill Iohn: since that time the kingdome of God is preached, and euery man preasseth into it.
\p
\v 17 And it is easier for heauen and earth to passe, then one title of the law to faile.
\p
\v 18 Whosoeuer putteth away his wife, & marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoeuer marrieth her that is put away from her husband, committeth adultery.
\p
\v 19 ¶ There was a certaine rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linnen, and fared sumptuously euery day.
\p
\v 20 And there was a certaine begger named Lazarus, which was layde at his gate full of sores,
\p
\v 21 And desiring to bee fed with the crummes which fel from the rich mans table: moreouer the dogges came and licked his sores.
\p
\v 22 And it came to passe that the begger died, and was caried by the Angels into Abrahams bosome: the rich man also died, and was buried.
\p
\v 23 And in hell he lift vp his eyes being in torments, and seeth Abraham afarre off, and Lazarus in his bosome:
\p
\v 24 And he cried, and said, Father Abraham, haue mercy on mee, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and coole my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.
\p
\v 25 But Abraham saide, Sonne, remember that thou in thy life-time receiuedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus euill things, but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
\p
\v 26 And besides all this, betweene vs and you there is a great gulfe fixed, so that they which would passe from hence to you, cannot, neither can they passe to vs, that would come from thence.
\p
\v 27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore father, that thou wouldest send him to my fathers house:
\p
\v 28 For I haue fiue brethren, that he may testifie vnto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
\p
\v 29 Abraham saith vnto him, They haue Moses and the Prophets, let them heare them.
\p
\v 30 And hee said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went vnto them from the dead, they will repent.
\p
\v 31 And hee said vnto him, If they heare not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be perswaded, though one rose from the dead.

\c 17
\p
\v 1 Then said he vnto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come, but wo vnto him through whom they come.
\p
\v 2 It were better for him that a milstone were hanged about his necke, and he cast into the Sea, then that he should offend one of these little ones.
\p
\v 3 ¶ Take heed to your selues: If thy brother trespasse against thee, rebuke him, and if he repent, forgiue him.
\p
\v 4 And if hee trespasse against thee seuen times in a day, and seuen times in a day turne againe to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgiue him.
\p
\v 5 And the Apostles said vnto the Lord, Increase our faith.
\p
\v 6 And the Lord said, If yee had faith as a graine of mustard seede, yee might say vnto this Sycamine tree, Be thou plucked vp by the root, and be thou planted in the sea, & it should obey you.
\p
\v 7 But which of you hauing a seruant plowing, or feeding cattell, will say vnto him by & by when he is come from the field, Goe and sit downe to meate?
\p
\v 8 And will not rather say vnto him, Make ready wherewith I may suppe, and gird thy selfe, and serue me, till I haue eaten and drunken: and afterward thou shalt eate and drinke.
\p
\v 9 Doeth he thanke that seruant, because hee did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.
\p
\v 10 So likewise ye, when ye shal haue done all those things which are commanded you, say, Wee are vnprofitable seruants: Wee haue done that which was our duety to doe.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And it came to passe, as he went to Hierusalem, that hee passed thorow the mids of Samaria and Galile.
\p
\v 12 And as he entred into a certaine village, there met him tenne men that were lepers, which stood afarre off.
\p
\v 13 And they lifted vp their voices, and said, Iesus master haue mercy on vs.
\p
\v 14 And when he saw them, hee said vnto them, Goe shew your selues vnto the Priests. And it came to passe, that as they went, they were cleansed.
\p
\v 15 And one of them when hee sawe that he was healed, turned backe, and with a loud voice glorified God,
\p
\v 16 And fell downe on his face at his feet, giuing him thanks: and he was a Samaritane.
\p
\v 17 And Iesus answering, said, Were there not ten cleansed, but where are the nine?
\p
\v 18 There are not found that returned to giue glory to God, saue this stranger.
\p
\v 19 And he said vnto him, Arise, go thy way, thy faith hath made thee whole.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And when hee was demanded of the Pharises, when the kingdome of God should come, hee answered them, and said, The kingdome of God commeth not with obseruation.
\p
\v 21 Neither shall they say, Loe here, or loe there: for behold, the kingdome of God is within you.
\p
\v 22 And hee said vnto the disciples, The dayes will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the dayes of the Sonne of man, and ye shall not see it.
\p
\v 23 And they shall say to you, See here, or see there: Goe not after them, nor follow them.
\p
\v 24 For as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part vnder heauen, shineth vnto the other part vnder heauen: so shall also the Sonne of man be in his day.
\p
\v 25 But first must hee suffer many things, & be reiected of this generation.
\p
\v 26 And as it was in the dayes of Noe: so shal it be also in the dayes of the Sonne of man.
\p
\v 27 They did eate, they dranke, they married wiues, they were giuen in mariage, vntill the day that Noe entred into the arke: and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
\p
\v 28 Likewise also as it was in the dayes of Lot, they did eat, they dranke, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded:
\p
\v 29 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodome, it rained fire and brimstone from heauen, & destroyed them all:
\p
\v 30 Euen thus shall it bee in the day when the Sonne of man is reuealed.
\p
\v 31 In that day he which shall be vpon the house top, and his stuffe in the house, let him not come downe to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not returne backe.
\p
\v 32 Remember Lots wife.
\p
\v 33 Whosoeuer shall seeke to saue his life, shall lose it, and whosoeuer shall lose his life, shall preserue it.
\p
\v 34 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shal be taken, the other shall be left.
\p
\v 35 Two women shall bee grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
\p
\v 36 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
\p
\v 37 And they answered, and said vnto him, Where, Lord? And he said vnto them, Wheresoeuer the body is, thither will the Eagles be gathered together.

\c 18
\p
\v 1 And he spake a parable vnto them, to this ende, that men ought alwayes to pray, and not to faint,
\p
\v 2 Saying, There was in a city a Iudge, which feared not God neither regarded man.
\p
\v 3 And there was a widowe in that citie, and she came vnto him, saying, Auenge me of mine aduersarie:
\p
\v 4 And hee would not for a while. But afterward he said within himselfe, Though I feare not God, nor regard man,
\p
\v 5 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will auenge her, lest by her continuall comming, she wearie me.
\p
\v 6 And the Lord said, Heare what the vniust iudge saith.
\p
\v 7 And shall not God auenge his owne elect, which crie day and night vnto him, thogh he beare long with them?
\p
\v 8 I tell you that he wil auenge them speedily. Neuerthelesse, when the Son of man commeth, shall hee find faith on the earth?
\p
\v 9 And he spake this parable vnto certaine which trusted in themselues that they were righteous, & despised other:
\p
\v 10 Two men went vp into the Temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a Publicane.
\p
\v 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himselfe, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, vniust, adulterers, or euen as this Publicane.
\p
\v 12 I fast twise in the weeke, I giue tithes of all that I possesse.
\p
\v 13 And the Publicane standing afarre off, would not lift vp so much as his eyes vnto heauen: but smote vpon his breast, saying, God me mercifull to mee a sinner.
\p
\v 14 I tell you, this man went downe to his house iustified rather then the other: For euery one that exalteth himselfe, shall be abased: and hee that humbleth himselfe, shall be exalted.
\p
\v 15 And they brought vnto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
\p
\v 16 But Iesus called them vnto him, and said, Suffer litle children to come vnto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdome of God.
\p
\v 17 Uerely I say vnto you, whosoeuer shall not receiue the kingdome of God as a litle child, shal in no wise enter therein.
\p
\v 18 And a certaine ruler asked him, saying, Good master, what shall I doe to inherit eternall life?
\p
\v 19 And Iesus said vnto him, Why callest thou mee good? None is good saue one, that is God.
\p
\v 20 Thou knowest the commaundements, Doe not commit adulterie, Doe not kill, Doe not steale, Doe not beare false witnesse, Honour thy father and thy mother.
\p
\v 21 And he said, All these haue I kept from my youth vp.
\p
\v 22 Now when Iesus heard these things, hee said vnto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: Sell all that thou hast, and distribute vnto the poore, and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen, and come, follow me.
\p
\v 23 And when he heard this, he was very sorowfull, for he was very rich.
\p
\v 24 And when Iesus saw that hee was very sorrowfull, he said, How hardly shal they that haue riches, enter into the kingdome of God?
\p
\v 25 For it is easier for a camel to goe thorow a needles eye, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 26 And they that heard it, said, Who then can be saued?
\p
\v 27 And he said, The things which are vnpossible with men, are possible with God.
\p
\v 28 Then Peter said, Loe, we haue left all, and followed thee.
\p
\v 29 And he said vnto them, Uerily, I say vnto you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdome of Gods sake,
\p
\v 30 Who shall not receiue manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life euerlasting.
\p
\v 31 ¶ Then hee tooke vnto him the twelue, and said vnto them, Behold, we goe vp to Hierusalem, and al things that are written by the Prophets concerning the sonne of man, shall be accomplished.
\p
\v 32 For he shall be deliuered vnto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully intreated, and spitted on:
\p
\v 33 And they shall scourge him, and put him to death, and the third day he shall rise againe.
\p
\v 34 And they vnderstood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
\p
\v 35 ¶ And it came to passe, that as he was come nigh vnto Iericho, a certaine blinde man sate by the way side, begging,
\p
\v 36 And hearing the multitude passe by, he asked what it meant.
\p
\v 37 And they tolde him that Iesus of Nazareth passeth by.
\p
\v 38 And he cried, saying, Iesus thou sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on me.
\p
\v 39 And they which went before, rebuked him, that hee should holde his peace: but hee cried so much the more, Thou Sonne of Dauid, haue mercie on mee.
\p
\v 40 And Iesus stood and commanded him to be brought vnto him: and when he was come neere, he asked him,
\p
\v 41 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall doe vnto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receiue my sight.
\p
\v 42 And Iesus said vnto him, Receiue thy sight, thy faith hath saued thee.
\p
\v 43 And immediately he receiued his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people when they saw it, gaue praise vnto God.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 And Iesus entred, and passed thorow Iericho.
\p
\v 2 And behold, there was a man named Zacheus, which was the cheefe among the Publicanes, and he was rich.
\p
\v 3 And he sought to see Iesus who he was, and could not for the prease, because he was litle of stature.
\p
\v 4 And he ranne before, and climed vp into a sycomore tree to see him, for he was to passe that way.
\p
\v 5 And when Iesus came to the place, he looked vp and saw him, and said vnto him, Zacheus, make haste, & come downe, for to day I must abide at thy house.
\p
\v 6 And he made haste, and came downe, and receiued him ioyfully.
\p
\v 7 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
\p
\v 8 And Zacheus stood, and said vnto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the halfe of my goods I giue to the poore, & if I haue taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him foure fold.
\p
\v 9 And Iesus said vnto him, This day is saluation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is the sonne of Abraham.
\p
\v 10 For the sonne of man is come to seeke, and to saue that which was lost.
\p
\v 11 And as they heard these things, he added, and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Hierusalem, and because they thought that the kingdome of God should immediately appeare.
\p
\v 12 He said therefore, A certaine noble man went into a farre countrey, to receiue for himselfe a kingdome, and to returne.
\p
\v 13 And hee called his ten seruants, and deliuered them ten pounds, and said vnto them, Occupy till I come.
\p
\v 14 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We wil not haue this man to reigne ouer vs.
\p
\v 15 And it came to passe, that when he was returned, hauing receiued the kingdome, then hee commaunded these seruants to be called vnto him, to whom he had giuen the money, that hee might know how much euery man had gained by trading.
\p
\v 16 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.
\p
\v 17 And he said vnto him, Well, thou good seruant: because thou hast bene faithfull in a very little, haue thou authoritie ouer ten cities.
\p
\v 18 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained fiue pounds.
\p
\v 19 And hee said likewise to him, Bee thou also ouer fiue cities.
\p
\v 20 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound which I haue kept layd vp in a napkin:
\p
\v 21 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest vp that thou layedst not downe, and reapest that thou didst not sow.
\p
\v 22 And hee saith vnto him, Out of thine owne mouth will I iudge thee, thou wicked seruant: Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking vp that I layde not downe, and reaping that I did not sow.
\p
\v 23 Wherefore then gauest not thou my money into the bancke, that at my comming I might haue required mine owne with vsury?
\p
\v 24 And he said vnto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and giue it to him that hath ten pounds.
\p
\v 25 And they said vnto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.
\p
\v 26 For I say vnto you, That vnto euery one which hath, shalbe giuen, and from him that hath not, euen that hee hath shalbe taken away from him.
\p
\v 27 But those mine enemies which would not that I should reigne ouer them, bring hither, and slay them before mee.
\p
\v 28 ¶ And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending vp to Hierusalem.
\p
\v 29 And it came to passe when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethanie, at the mount called the mount of Oliues, he sent two of his disciples,
\p
\v 30 Saying, Goe ye into the village ouer against you, in the which at your entring ye shall find a Colt tied, whereon yet neuer man sate: loose him, and bring him hither.
\p
\v 31 And if any man aske you, Why do ye loose him? Thus shall ye say vnto him, Because the Lord hath neede of him.
\p
\v 32 And they that were sent, went their way, and found euen as hee had said vnto them.
\p
\v 33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said vnto them, Why loose ye the Colt?
\p
\v 34 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.
\p
\v 35 And they brought him to Iesus: and they cast their garments vpon the Colt, and they set Iesus thereon.
\p
\v 36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
\p
\v 37 And when he was come nigh euen now at the descent of the mount of Oliues, the whole multitude of the disciples began to reioyce and praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty workes that they had seene,
\p
\v 38 Saying, Blessed bee the King that commeth in the Name of the Lord, peace in heauen, and glory in the Highest.
\p
\v 39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude saide vnto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
\p
\v 40 And he answered, and said vnto them, I tell you, that if these should holde their peace, the stones would immediatly cry out.
\p
\v 41 ¶ And when he was come neere, he beheld the city and wept ouer it,
\p
\v 42 Saying, If thou hadst knowen, euen thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong vnto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.
\p
\v 43 For the dayes shall come vpon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compasse thee round, and keepe thee in on euery side,
\p
\v 44 And shall lay thee euen with the ground, and thy children within thee: and they shall not leaue in thee one stone vpon another, because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
\p
\v 45 And he went into the Temple, and began to cast out them that solde therein, and them that bought,
\p
\v 46 Saying vnto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye haue made it a denne of theeues.
\p
\v 47 And he taught daily in the Temple. But the chiefe Priestes and the Scribes, and the chiefe of the people sought to destroy him,
\p
\v 48 And could not finde what they might doe: for all the people were very attentiue to heare him.

\c 20
\p
\v 1 And it came to passe, that on one of those dayes, as he taught the people in the Temple, and preached the Gospel, the chiefe Priests and the Scribes came vpon him, with the Elders,
\p
\v 2 And spake vnto him, saying, Tell vs, by what authoritie doest thou these things? or who is hee that gaue thee this authoritie?
\p
\v 3 And hee answered, and said vnto them, I will also aske you one thing, and answere me.
\p
\v 4 The Baptisme of Iohn, was it from heauen, or of men?
\p
\v 5 And they reasoned with themselues, saying, If wee shall say, From heauen, he will say, Why then beleeued yee him not?
\p
\v 6 But and if we say, Of men, all the people will stone vs: for they be perswaded that Iohn was a Prophet.
\p
\v 7 And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.
\p
\v 8 And Iesus said vnto them, Neither tell I you by what authoritie I doe these things.
\p
\v 9 Then began hee to speake to the people this parable: A certaine man planted a vineyard, and let it foorth to husbandmen, and went into a farre countrey for a long time.
\p
\v 10 And at the season, hee sent a seruant to the husbandmen, that they should giue him of the fruit of the vineyard, but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away emptie.
\p
\v 11 And againe hee sent another seruant, and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away emptie.
\p
\v 12 And againe he sent the third, and they wounded him also, & cast him out.
\p
\v 13 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I doe? I will send my beloued sonne: it may be they will reuerence him when they see him.
\p
\v 14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselues, saying, This is &thorn;e heire, come, let vs kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
\p
\v 15 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard doe vnto them?
\p
\v 16 Hee shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall giue the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.
\p
\v 17 And hee beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders reiected, the same is become the head of the corner?
\p
\v 18 Whosoeuer shall fall vpon that stone, shalbe broken: but on whomsoeuer it shall fall, it will grinde him to powder.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And the chiefe Priests and the Scribes the same houre sought to lay hands on him, and they feared the people: for they perceiued that he had spoken this parable against them.
\p
\v 20 And they watched him, and sent foorth spies, which should faine themselues iust men, that they might take holde of his words, that so they might deliuer him vnto the power and authoritie of the gouernour.
\p
\v 21 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truely.
\p
\v 22 Is it lawfull for vs to giue tribute vnto Cesar, or no?
\p
\v 23 But he perceiued their craftines, and said vnto them, Why tempt ye me?
\p
\v 24 Shew me a peny: whose image and superscription hath it? They answered, and said, Cesars.
\p
\v 25 And he said vnto them, Render therefore vnto Cesar the things which be Cesars, and vnto God the things which be Gods.
\p
\v 26 And they could not take holde of his wordes before the people, and they marueiled at his answere, and helde their peace.
\p
\v 27 ¶ Then came to him certaine of the Sadduces (which denie that there is any resurrection) and they asked him,
\p
\v 28 Saying, Master, Moses wrote vnto vs, If any mans brother die, hauing a wife, and hee die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise vp seede vnto his brother.
\p
\v 29 There were therefore seuen brethren, and the first tooke a wife, and died without children.
\p
\v 30 And the second tooke her to wife, and he died childlesse.
\p
\v 31 And the third tooke her, and in like maner the seuen also. And they left no children, and died.
\p
\v 32 Last of all the woman died also.
\p
\v 33 Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife of them is she? for seuen had her to wife.
\p
\v 34 And Iesus answering, said vnto them, The children of this world, marrie, and are giuen in marriage:
\p
\v 35 But they which shall be accompted worthy to obtaine that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marrie, nor are giuen in marriage.
\p
\v 36 Neither can they die any more; for they are equall vnto the Angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
\p
\v 37 Now that the dead are raised, euen Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isahac, and the God of Iacob.
\p
\v 38 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the liuing for all liue vnto him.
\p
\v 39 ¶ Then certaine of the Scribes answering, said, Master, Thou hast well said.
\p
\v 40 And after that, they durst not aske him any question at all.
\p
\v 41 And he said vnto them, How say they that Christ is Dauids sonne?
\p
\v 42 And Dauid himselfe saith in the booke of Psalmes, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
\p
\v 43 Till I make thine enemies thy footestoole.
\p
\v 44 Dauid therefore calleth him, Lord, how is he then his sonne?
\p
\v 45 ¶ Then in the audience of all the people, he said vnto his disciples,
\p
\v 46 Beware of the Scribes, which desire to walke in long robes, and loue greetings in the markets, and the highest seates in the Synagogues, and the chiefe roumes at feasts:
\p
\v 47 Which deuoure widowes houses and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receiue greater damnation.

\c 21
\p
\v 1 And he looked vp, and saw the rich men casting their giftes into the treasurie.
\p
\v 2 And hee saw also a certaine poore widow, casting in thither two mites.
\p
\v 3 And he said, Of a truth, I say vnto you, that this poore widow hath cast in more then they all.
\p
\v 4 For all these haue of their abundance cast in vnto the offerings of God, but shee of her penurie hath cast in all the liuing that she had.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And as some spake of the Temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones, and gifts, he said,
\p
\v 6 As for these things which yee behold, the dayes will come, in the which there shal not be left one stone vpon another, that shal not be throwen downe.
\p
\v 7 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what signe wil there be, when these things shall come to passe?
\p
\v 8 And he said, Take heede that yee be not deceiued: for many shall come in my Name, saying, I am Christ, and the time draweth neere: goe yee not therefore after them.
\p
\v 9 But when ye shall heare of wars, and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to passe, but the end is not by and by.
\p
\v 10 Then said he vnto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdome against kingdome:
\p
\v 11 And great earthquakes shall be in diuers places, and famines, and pestilences: and fearefull sights and great signes shall there be from heauen.
\p
\v 12 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute you, deliuering you vp to the Synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before Kings and rulers for my Names sake.
\p
\v 13 And it shall turne to you for a testimony.
\p
\v 14 Settle it therfore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answere.
\p
\v 15 For I will giue you a mouth and wisedome, which all your aduersaries shall not be able to gainsay, nor resist.
\p
\v 16 And yee shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren, and kinsefolkes and friends, and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.
\p
\v 17 And ye shalbe hated of all men for my Names sake.
\p
\v 18 But there shall not a haire of your head perish.
\p
\v 19 In your patience possesse ye your soules.
\p
\v 20 And when yee shall see Hierusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.
\p
\v 21 Then let them which are in Iudea, flee to the mountaines, and let them which are in the midst of it, depart out, and let not them that are in the countreys, enter thereinto.
\p
\v 22 For these be the dayes of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
\p
\v 23 But woe vnto them that are with childe, and to them that giue sucke in those dayes, for there shalbe great distresse in the land, and wrath vpon this people.
\p
\v 24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall bee led away captiue into all nations, and Hierusalem shall be troden downe of the Gentiles, vntill the times of the Gentiles bee fulfilled.
\p
\v 25 ¶ And there shalbe signes in the Sunne, and in the Moone, and in the Starres, and vpon the earth distresse of nations, with perplexity, the Sea and the waues roaring,
\p
\v 26 Mens hearts failing them for feare, and for looking after those things which are comming on the earth; For the powers of heauen shall be shaken.
\p
\v 27 And then shall they see the sonne of man comming in a cloud with power and great glory.
\p
\v 28 And when these things begin to come to passe, then looke vp, and lift vp your heads, for your redemptiou draweth nigh.
\p
\v 29 And he spake to them a parable, Behold the figge tree, and all the trees,
\p
\v 30 When they now shoot foorth, yee see and know of your owne selues, that summer is now nigh at hand.
\p
\v 31 So likewise yee, when yee see these things come to passe, know ye that the kingdome of God is nigh at hand.
\p
\v 32 Uerily I say vnto you, this generation shall not passe away, till all be fulfilled.
\p
\v 33 Heauen and earth shall passe away, but my words shall not passe away.
\p
\v 34 ¶ And take heed to your selues, least at any time your hearts be ouercharged with surfetting, and drunkennesse, and cares of this life, and so that day come vpon you vnawares.
\p
\v 35 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
\p
\v 36 Watch ye therefore, and pray alwayes, that ye may be accompted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to passe, and to stand before the sonne of man.
\p
\v 37 And in the day time he was teaching in the Temple, and at night hee went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Oliues.
\p
\v 38 And all the people came earely in the morning to him in the Temple, for to heare him.

\c 22
\p
\v 1 Now &thorn;e feast of vnleuened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passeouer.
\p
\v 2 And the chiefe Priests and Scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.
\p
\v 3 ¶ Then entred Satan into Iudas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelue.
\p
\v 4 And he went his way, and communed with the chiefe Priests and captaines, how he might betray him vnto them.
\p
\v 5 And they were glad, and couenanted to giue him money.
\p
\v 6 And he promised, and sought opportunitie to betray him vnto them in the absence of the multitude.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Then came the day of vnleauened bread, when the Passeouer must be killed.
\p
\v 8 And he sent Peter and Iohn, saying, Goe and prepare vs the Passeouer, that we may eate.
\p
\v 9 And they said vnto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
\p
\v 10 And he said vnto them, Behold, when ye are entred into the citie, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water, follow him into the house where he entreth in.
\p
\v 11 And yee shall say vnto the goodman of the house, The Master saith vnto thee, Where is the ghest-chamber where I shall eate the Passeouer with my disciples?
\p
\v 12 And he shall shew you a large vpper roume furnished, there make ready.
\p
\v 13 And they went, and found as hee had said vnto them, and they made readie the Passeouer.
\p
\v 14 And when the houre was come, he sate downe, and the twelue Apostles with him.
\p
\v 15 And he said vnto them, With desire I haue desired to eate this Passeouer with you before I suffer.
\p
\v 16 For I say vnto you, I will not any more eate thereof, vntill it be fulfilled in the kingdome of God.
\p
\v 17 And hee tooke the cup, and gaue thanks, and said, Take this, and diuide it among your selues.
\p
\v 18 For I say vnto you, I will not drinke of the fruit of the Uine, vntill the kingdome of God shall come.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And hee tooke bread, and gaue thankes, and brake it, and gaue vnto them, saying, This is my body which is giuen for you, this doe in remembrance of me.
\p
\v 20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the New Testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
\p
\v 21 ¶ But beholde, the hand of him that betrayeth mee, is with mee on the table.
\p
\v 22 And truly the Sonne of man goeth as it was determined, but woe vnto that man by whom he is betraied.
\p
\v 23 And they began to enquire among themselues, which of them it was that should doe this thing.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And there was also a strife among them, which of them should bee accompted the greatest.
\p
\v 25 And hee saide vnto them, The Kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship ouer them, & they that exercise authoritie vpon them, are called benefactors.
\p
\v 26 But ye shall not be so; but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the yonger, and he that is chiefe, as he that doeth serue.
\p
\v 27 For whether is greater, hee that sitteth at meat, or hee that serueth? Is not he that sitteth at meat? But I am among you as he that serueth.
\p
\v 28 Ye are they which haue continued with me in my temptations.
\p
\v 29 And I appoint vnto you a kingdome, as my Father hath appointed vnto me,
\p
\v 30 That yee may eate and drinke at my table in my kingdome, and sit on thrones iudging the twelue Tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 31 ¶ And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, beholde, Satan hath desired to haue you, that he may sift you as wheat:
\p
\v 32 But I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not; and when thou art conuerted, strengthen thy brethren.
\p
\v 33 And hee said vnto him, Lord, I am ready to goe with thee both into prison, and to death.
\p
\v 34 And hee said, I tell thee Peter, the cocke shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrise denie that thou knowest me.
\p
\v 35 And he said vnto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shooes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.
\p
\v 36 Then saide hee vnto them, But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and hee that hath no sword, let him sel his garment, and buy one.
\p
\v 37 For I say vnto you, that this that is written, must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: For the things concerning me haue an end.
\p
\v 38 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And hee saide vnto them, It is ynough.
\p
\v 39 ¶ And he came out, and went, as hee was wont, to the mount of Oliues, and his disciples also followed him.
\p
\v 40 And when he was at the place, he said vnto them, Pray, that yee enter not into temptation.
\p
\v 41 And he was withdrawen from them about a stones cast, and kneeled downe, and prayed,
\p
\v 42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remooue this cup from me: neuerthelesse, not my will, but thine be done.
\p
\v 43 And there appeared an Angel vnto him from heauen, strengthening him.
\p
\v 44 And being in an agonie, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling downe to the ground.
\p
\v 45 And when he rose vp from prayer, and was come to his disciples, hee found them sleeping for sorrow,
\p
\v 46 And said vnto them, Why sleepe yee? Rise, and pray, lest yee enter into temptation.
\p
\v 47 ¶ And while he yet spake, behold, a multitude, and hee that was called Iudas, one of the twelue, went before them, and drewe neere vnto Iesus, to kisse him.
\p
\v 48 But Iesus said vnto him, Iudas, betrayest thou the sonne of man with a kisse?
\p
\v 49 When they which were about him, saw what would follow, they said vnto him, Lord, shall wee smite with the sword?
\p
\v 50 ¶ And one of them smote the seruant of the high Priest, and cut off his right eare.
\p
\v 51 And Iesus answered, and said, Suffer ye thus farre. And he touched his eare, and healed him.
\p
\v 52 Then Iesus said vnto the chiefe Priests, and captaines of the Temple, and the Elders which were come to him, Be ye come out as against a thiefe, with swords and staues?
\p
\v 53 When I was daily with you in the Temple, yee stretched foorth no hands against mee: but this is your houre, and the power of darkenesse.
\p
\v 54 ¶ Then tooke they him, and led him, and brought him into the high Priests house, and Peter followed afarre off.
\p
\v 55 And when they had kindled a fire in the middes of the hall, and were set downe together, Peter sate downe among them.
\p
\v 56 But a certaine maide beheld him as he sate by the fire, and earnestly looked vpon him, and said, This man was also with him.
\p
\v 57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
\p
\v 58 And after a little while another saw him, & said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
\p
\v 59 And about the space of one houre after, another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a trueth this fellow also was with him; for he is a Galilean.
\p
\v 60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately while he yet spake, the cocke crew.
\p
\v 61 And the Lord turned, and looked vpon Peter; and Peter remembred the word of the Lord, how he had said vnto him, Before the cocke crow, thou shalt deny me thrise.
\p
\v 62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
\p
\v 63 ¶ And the men that helde Iesus, mocked him, and smote him.
\p
\v 64 And when they had blindfolded him, they stroke him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesie, who is it that smote thee?
\p
\v 65 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
\p
\v 66 ¶ And assoone as it was day, the Elders of the people, & the chiefe Priests and the Scribes came together, and led him into their Councell, saying,
\p
\v 67 Art thou the Christ? Tell vs. And hee said vnto them, If I tell you, you will not beleeue.
\p
\v 68 And if I also aske you, you will not answere me, nor let me goe.
\p
\v 69 Hereafter shal the sonne of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.
\p
\v 70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Sonne of God? And hee said vnto them, Ye say that I am.
\p
\v 71 And they said, What need we any further witnesse? For wee our selues haue heard of his owne mouth.

\c 23
\p
\v 1 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him vnto Pilate.
\p
\v 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow peruerting the nation, and forbidding to giue tribute to Cesar, saying, that he himselfe is Christ a king.
\p
\v 3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the king of the Iewes? And he answered him, & said, Thou sayest it.
\p
\v 4 Then saide Pilate to the chiefe Priests, and to the people, I finde no fault in this man.
\p
\v 5 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth vp the people, teaching thorowout all Iurie, beginning from Galilee to this place.
\p
\v 6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean.
\p
\v 7 And assoone as he knew that hee belonged vnto Herods iurisdiction, hee sent him to Herode, who himselfe also was at Hierusalem at that time.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And when Herode saw Iesus, he was exceeding glad, for hee was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him, and hee hoped to haue seene some miracle done by him.
\p
\v 9 Then he questioned with him in many words, but he answered him nothing.
\p
\v 10 And the chiefe Priests and Scribes stood, and vehemently accused him.
\p
\v 11 And Herod with his men of warre set him at naught, and mocked him, and arayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him againe to Pilate.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together; for before, they were at enmitie betweene themselues.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And Pilate, when hee had called together the chiefe Priests, and the rulers, and the people,
\p
\v 14 Said vnto them, Ye haue brought this man vnto me, as one that peruerteth the people, and behold, I hauing examined him before you, haue found no fault in this man, touching those things whereof ye accuse him.
\p
\v 15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him, and loe, nothing worthy of death is done vnto him.
\p
\v 16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
\p
\v 17 For of necessitie hee must release one vnto them at the Feast.
\p
\v 18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release vnto vs Barabbas,
\p
\v 19 Who for a certaine sedition made in the citie, and for murder, was cast in prison.
\p
\v 20 Pilate therefore willing to release Iesus, spake againe to them:
\p
\v 21 But they cried, saying, Crucifie him, crucifie him.
\p
\v 22 And hee said vnto them the third time, Why, what euill hath he done? I haue found no cause of death in him, I will therefore chastise him, & let him goe.
\p
\v 23 And they were instant with loud voyces, requiring that he might be crucified: and the voyces of them, and of the chiefe Priests preuailed.
\p
\v 24 And Pilate gaue sentence that it should be as they required.
\p
\v 25 And he released vnto them, him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired, but he deliuered Iesus to their will.
\p
\v 26 And as they led him away, they laid hold vpon one Simon a Cyrenian, comming out of the countrey, and on him they laid the crosse, that hee might beare it after Iesus.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed & lamented him.
\p
\v 28 But Iesus turning vnto them, said, Daughters of Hierusalem, weepe not for me, but weepe for your selues, and for your children.
\p
\v 29 For beholde, the dayes are comming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that neuer bare, and the paps which neuer gaue sucke.
\p
\v 30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountaines, Fall on vs, and to the hils, Couer vs.
\p
\v 31 For if they doe these things in a green tree, what shalbe done in the drie?
\p
\v 32 And there were also two other malefactors led with him, to bee put to death.
\p
\v 33 And when they were come to the place which is called Caluarie, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
\p
\v 34 ¶ Then said Iesus, Father, forgiue them, for they know not what they doe: And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
\p
\v 35 And the people stood beholding, & the rulers also with them derided him, saying, Hee saued others, let him saue himselfe, if he be Christ, &thorn;e chosen of God.
\p
\v 36 And the souldiers also mocked him, comming to him, and offering him vineger,
\p
\v 37 And saying, If thou be the king of the Iewes, saue thy selfe.
\p
\v 38 And a superscription also was written ouer him in letters of Greeke, and Latin, & Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE IEWES.
\p
\v 39 ¶ And one of &thorn;e malefactors, which were hanged, railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, saue thy selfe and vs.
\p
\v 40 But the other answering, rebuked him, saying, Doest not thou feare God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
\p
\v 41 And we indeed iustly; for we receiue the due reward of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing amisse.
\p
\v 42 And he said vnto Iesus, Lord, remember me when thou commest into thy kingdome.
\p
\v 43 And Iesus said vnto him, Uerily, I say vnto thee, to day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.
\p
\v 44 And it was about the sixt houre, and there was a darkenesse ouer all the earth, vntill the ninth houre.
\p
\v 45 And the Sunne was darkened, and the vaile of the temple was rent in the mids.
\p
\v 46 ¶ And when Iesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: And hauing said thus, he gaue vp the ghost.
\p
\v 47 Now when the Centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
\p
\v 48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
\p
\v 49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood a farre off, beholding these things.
\p
\v 50 ¶ And behold, there was a man named Ioseph, a counseller, and hee was a good man, and a iust.
\p
\v 51 (The same had not consented to the counsell and deede of them) he was of Arimathea, a city of the Iewes (who also himselfe waited for the kingdome of God.)
\p
\v 52 This man went vnto Pilate, and begged the body of Iesus.
\p
\v 53 And he tooke it downe, and wrapped it in linnen, and layd it in a Sepulchre that was hewen in stone, wherein neuer man before was layd.
\p
\v 54 And that day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew on.
\p
\v 55 And the women also which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the Sepulchre, and how his body was layd.
\p
\v 56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments, and rested the Sabbath day, according to the commandement.

\c 24
\p
\v 1 Now vpon the first day of the weeke, very earely in the morning, they came vnto the Sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certaine others with them.
\p
\v 2 And they found the stone rolled away from the Sepulchre.
\p
\v 3 And they entred in, and found not the body of the Lord Iesus.
\p
\v 4 And it came to passe, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments.
\p
\v 5 And as they were afraid, and bowed downe their faces to the earth, they said vnto them, Why seek ye the liuing among the dead?
\p
\v 6 He is not heere, but is risen: Remember how he spake vnto you when he was yet in Galilee,
\p
\v 7 Saying, The Sonne of man must be deliuered into the hands of sinfull men, and be crucified, and the third day rise againe.
\p
\v 8 And they remembred his words,
\p
\v 9 And returned from the Sepulchre, and told all these things vnto the eleuen, and to all the rest.
\p
\v 10 It was Marie Magdalene, & Ioanna, & Mary the mother of Iames, and other women that were with them, which tolde these things vnto the Apostles.
\p
\v 11 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they beleeued them not.
\p
\v 12 Then arose Peter, and ranne vnto the Sepulchre, and stowping downe, hee behelde the linnen clothes layd by themselues, and departed, wondering in himselfe at that which was come to passe.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emaus, which was from Hierusalem about threescore furlongs.
\p
\v 14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
\p
\v 15 And it came to passe, that while they communed together, and reasoned, Iesus himselfe drew neere, and went with them.
\p
\v 16 But their eyes were holden, that they should not know him.
\p
\v 17 And he said vnto them, What maner of communications are these that yee haue one to another as yee walke, and are sad?
\p
\v 18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, saide vnto him, Art thou onely a stranger in Hierusalem, and hast not knowen the things which are come to passe there in these dayes?
\p
\v 19 And hee saide vnto them, What things? And they said vnto him, Concerning Iesus of Nazareth, which was a Prophet, mighty in deede and word before God, and all the people.
\p
\v 20 And how the chiefe Priests and our rulers deliuered him to be condemned to death, and haue crucified him.
\p
\v 21 But wee trusted that it had bene hee, which should haue redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
\p
\v 22 Yea, and certaine women also of our company made vs astonished, which were early at the Sepulchre:
\p
\v 23 And when they found not his bodie, they came, saying, that they had also seene a vision of Angels, which saide that he was aliue.
\p
\v 24 And certaine of them which were with vs, went to the Sepulchre, and found it euen so as the women had said, but him they saw not.
\p
\v 25 Then hee saide vnto them, O fooles, and slow of heart to beleeue all that the Prophets haue spoken:
\p
\v 26 Ought not Christ to haue suffered these things, and to enter into his glorie?
\p
\v 27 And beginning at Moses, and all the Prophets, hee expounded vnto them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himselfe.
\p
\v 28 And they drew nigh vnto the village, whither they went, and hee made as though hee would haue gone further.
\p
\v 29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with vs, for it is towards euening, and the day is farre spent: And he went in, to tarrie with them.
\p
\v 30 And it came to passe, as hee sate at meate with them, hee tooke bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gaue to them.
\p
\v 31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight.
\p
\v 32 And they said one vnto another, Did not our heart burne within vs, while hee talked with vs by the way, and while hee opened to vs the Scriptures?
\p
\v 33 And they rose vp the same houre, and returned to Hierusalem, and found the eleuen gathered together, and them that were with them,
\p
\v 34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
\p
\v 35 And they told what things were done in the way, & how he was knowen of them in breaking of bread.
\p
\v 36 ¶ And as they thus spake, Iesus himselfe stood in the midst of them, and sayeth vnto them, Peace bee vnto you.
\p
\v 37 But they were terrified, and afrighted, and supposed that they had seene a spirit.
\p
\v 38 And he said vnto them, Why are yee troubled, and why doe thoughts arise in your hearts?
\p
\v 39 Beholde my hands and my feete, that it is I my selfe: handle me, and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me haue.
\p
\v 40 And when hee had thus spoken, hee shewed them his handes and his feete.
\p
\v 41 And while they yet beleeued not for ioy, and wondered, hee saide vnto them, Haue ye here any meat?
\p
\v 42 And they gaue him a piece of a broyled fish, and of an hony combe.
\p
\v 43 And he tooke it, and did eate before them.
\p
\v 44 And hee said vnto them, These are the words which I spake vnto you, while I was yet with you, &thorn;t all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the Law of Moses, & in the Prophets, and in the Psalmes concerning me.
\p
\v 45 Then opened he their vnderstanding, that they might vnderstand the Scriptures,
\p
\v 46 And said vnto them, Thus it is written, & thus it behoued Christ to suffer, & to rise from the dead the third day:
\p
\v 47 And that repentance and remission of sinnes should be preached in his Name, among all nations, beginning at Hierusalem.
\p
\v 48 And yee are witnesses of these things.
\p
\v 49 ¶ And behold, I send the promise of my Father vpon you: but tarie ye in the citie of Hierusalem, vntill ye be indued with power from on high.
\p
\v 50 ¶ And he led them out as farre as to Bethanie, and hee lift vp his hands, and blessed them.
\p
\v 51 And it came to passe, while hee blessed them, hee was parted from them, and caried vp into heauen.
\p
\v 52 And they worshipped him, and returned to Hierusalem, with great ioy:
\p
\v 53 And were continually in the Temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
